2013-11-09 00:42:06	@J	I need to treat grouped momentum differently
2013-11-09 00:42:28	@J	maybe think about changes rather than total values
2013-11-09 00:42:53	@J	but that can wait until tomorrow
2013-11-09 00:43:02	@J	goodnight
2013-11-09 00:43:22	@J	also, I was thinking about how collisions should work if I did rotation
2013-11-09 00:43:31	@J	and also n-dimensional collision detection/resolution
2013-11-09 00:43:40	@J	that would definitely be a thing

2013-11-09 12:23:25	-->	Espyo (Mibbit@y17-487-00-406.cpe.netcabo.pt) has joined #pikipedia
2013-11-09 12:43:34	@J	hmm, this is weird
2013-11-09 12:43:50	@J	I've only really made changes to collision resolution, but now collision detection is running slowly
2013-11-09 12:44:11	@J	actually quite laggy with >~20 collisions per frame
2013-11-09 12:44:31	@J	and 20 objects
2013-11-09 12:46:18	Espyo	sounds like a for loop issue
2013-11-09 12:47:40	@J	yeah, but I would've expected it to happen before I started making changes
2013-11-09 12:47:44	@J	but it wasn't bad before
2013-11-09 12:48:13	@J	it would run smoothly up to ~150 collisions per frame
2013-11-09 12:49:15	Espyo	that's actually pretty good
2013-11-09 12:53:10	@J	I would say it's to be expected - it's fast because it's simple, but no faster because it's Python and unoptimised
2013-11-09 12:53:47	Espyo	right, I was kinda taking Python's slithering into account
2013-11-09 12:54:14	@J	collision detection ATM is very brute-force
2013-11-09 12:54:44	@J	I want to do resolution, the hard part, first, and if I actually manage it, _then_ optimise
2013-11-09 12:55:20	Espyo	hmmm, right
2013-11-09 12:56:51	@J	...infinite loop running into a wall
2013-11-09 13:11:18	@J	remaining_vel[o.shape] = [t * vx, t * vx]
2013-11-09 13:11:21	@J	...spot the typo
2013-11-09 13:11:59	Espyo	t*vx, t*vx
2013-11-09 13:12:00	Espyo	classic
2013-11-09 13:12:29	@J	and now I have vy becoming inf when colliding with 2 walls at once
2013-11-09 13:13:59	@J	...oh
2013-11-09 13:14:19	@J	because I used the absolute value of the impulse (change in momentum) to change the velocity
2013-11-09 13:14:30	@J	so in one direction, everything works fine; in the other, it shoots off to infinity
2013-11-09 13:14:42	Espyo	hehe
2013-11-09 13:17:32	@J	okay, surprisingly, everything seems to be working fine with 2 objects
2013-11-09 13:18:04	@J	...except that friction goes in the wrong direction
2013-11-09 13:18:16	@J	that's just weird to watch
2013-11-09 13:18:27	Espyo	that's a really friction-thing to happen, really
2013-11-09 13:18:39	Espyo	the whole going backwards thing
2013-11-09 13:39:21	@J	so, currently it's possible to ignore a collision by returning True from a 'before' callback
2013-11-09 13:39:30	@J	but should this be possible?
2013-11-09 13:39:48	@J	it'll mess everything up, and if you don't want things to collide you should probably just put them in different layers
2013-11-09 13:39:48	Espyo	doesn't really sound like it should
2013-11-09 13:40:33	@J	if it's not, then the only thing the before callback really lets you do is change the combined elasticity/friction of the collision
2013-11-09 13:40:39	@J	but is that even necessary?
2013-11-09 13:40:53	@J	I guess if you want weird values, like depending on speed or something
2013-11-09 13:41:06	@J	or some other parametr
2013-11-09 13:41:08	@J	*parameter
2013-11-09 13:41:22	@J	like, a rubber ball gets less bouncy as you heat it up or something
2013-11-09 13:41:29	@J	(no idea if that's actually a thing)
2013-11-09 13:41:38	Espyo	hmmm
2013-11-09 13:41:47	Espyo	kinda sounds like it would be a thing the other way around... maybe
2013-11-09 13:42:01	Espyo	ask xkcd? heh
2013-11-09 13:42:58	@J	or maybe the graph's a hump with an optimal temperature
2013-11-09 13:43:05	@J	anyway, is that useful?
2013-11-09 13:43:24	@J	I currently have 3 callback types: before, after, and touching
2013-11-09 13:43:43	@J	after is useful for playing sounds, computing damage, destroying objects, etc.
2013-11-09 13:43:52	Espyo	I feel like it wouldn't be too useful, but
2013-11-09 13:44:00	Espyo	...got lunch
2013-11-09 13:44:06	@J	touching is called every frame they're touching, for checking if the player can jump and things
2013-11-09 13:44:09	@J	'kay
2013-11-09 13:44:23	@J	also, not sure if/how these callbacks should be called for group collisions
2013-11-09 13:45:19	@J	probably for pairs that originally collided to form the group
2013-11-09 13:45:22	@J	maybe
2013-11-09 14:05:25	@J	...okay, I didn't even think that maybe you went for lunch because it's lunch time
2013-11-09 14:05:29	@J	sudden hungre
2013-11-09 14:05:31	@J	*hunger
2013-11-09 14:13:35	Espyo	hah, hungre
2013-11-09 16:24:03	@J	hate floating point errors so much
2013-11-09 16:24:26	@J	so I have 2 objects touching, both moving in the same direction
2013-11-09 16:24:37	@J	left one has speed something like 1.123456789999
2013-11-09 16:24:45	@J	right one has 1.12345678995
2013-11-09 16:25:01	@J	so they collide at what equates to 0 seconds
2013-11-09 16:25:23	@J	and the collision resolver doesn't make any changes to their speeds
2013-11-09 16:25:49	Espyo	hehe
2013-11-09 16:26:02	@J	ideas?
2013-11-09 16:26:03	Espyo	isn't Python actually kinda good at dealing with floating point precision errors?
2013-11-09 16:26:06	Espyo	C++ just doesn't care
2013-11-09 16:26:12	@J	no better than any other language
2013-11-09 16:26:17	@J	what do you mean, doesn't care?
2013-11-09 16:26:22	Espyo	well, last time I had a floating point precision problem, I stopped using doubles and used floats
2013-11-09 16:26:30	Espyo	because the less precise it is, the more precise it is
2013-11-09 16:26:36	@J	what
2013-11-09 16:26:46	Espyo	well, I figured Python did some things to avoid precision errors, whereas C++ does not
2013-11-09 16:26:49	@J	mm
2013-11-09 16:26:51	Espyo	yeah, my problem was solved by using floats
2013-11-09 16:26:57	@J	well, there's an arbitrary precision floating point library
2013-11-09 16:27:10	@J	but it's not the kind of thing you use for this stuff
2013-11-09 16:27:14	Espyo	of course
2013-11-09 16:27:19	@J	more for adding money amounts
2013-11-09 16:27:34	@J	it uses some algorithm in generating strings from floats to reduce errors there
2013-11-09 16:27:47	@J	but for the actual representation there's not much you can do
2013-11-09 16:28:04	Espyo	right
2013-11-09 16:28:08	Espyo	hmm
2013-11-09 16:28:10	@J	I also have floating point errors in positions - I move everything up to the point where they collide, but they're not quite toching
2013-11-09 16:28:11	@J	*touching
2013-11-09 16:28:21	@J	but this is something I can manually adjust, and it's fine
2013-11-09 16:28:24	Espyo	well, in real life, nothing really "touches", so...
2013-11-09 16:28:28	@J	velocity, on the other hand...
2013-11-09 16:28:38	@J	yes, but it's important that they touch here
2013-11-09 16:28:42	Espyo	hehe, of course

2013-11-10 14:09:41	@J	http://geekblog.oneandoneis2.org/index.php/2013/11/09/the-internet
2013-11-10 14:24:21	Espyo	oh wow
2013-11-10 14:24:34	Espyo	the internet never fails to deliver
2013-11-10 14:50:38	@J	okay, I hacked around the floating-point error in the simple case, but it seems to be happening in complicated cases too
2013-11-10 14:51:42	Espyo	well, it's to be expected
2013-11-10 14:51:56	@J	and even when elasticity is 1
2013-11-10 14:52:05	@J	that's kind of weird, really
2013-11-10 14:53:38	@J	actually, it still seems to be happening in the simple case - maybe I didn't fix it properly
2013-11-10 14:53:45	Espyo	ah
2013-11-10 14:58:24	@J	...okay, ignore everything I just said
2013-11-10 14:58:51	@J	what's happening is each collision, the velocities of the two things colliding get switched round, somehow
2013-11-10 15:00:43	@J	...on one axis
2013-11-10 15:03:23	@J	ooh, that's pretty crazy
2013-11-10 15:03:44	@J	2 objects collide, then one hits a wall
2013-11-10 15:04:18	@J	because the objects are grouped, the resolution of that collision ends up with one still moving towards the wall, because the other's moving away from the wall so fast
2013-11-10 15:09:58	Espyo	...how
2013-11-10 15:10:43	@J	I know
2013-11-10 15:16:51	@J	I can't quite work out how the exact same thing is happening with elasticity = 0, but at least it's that and not _another_ thing
2013-11-10 15:17:57	Espyo	tried elasticity = infinite yet?
2013-11-10 15:17:59	Espyo	should be fun
2013-11-10 15:19:07	@J	how do I do that?
2013-11-10 15:19:18	@J	if I actually use inf, everything will just break
2013-11-10 15:19:36	@J	any elasticity > 1 increases energy over time, if that's what you were going for
2013-11-10 15:23:11	Espyo	does Python have a concept of an actual infinite value?
2013-11-10 15:23:15	@J	yeah
2013-11-10 15:23:19	Espyo	nice
2013-11-10 15:23:27	Espyo	"increases energy over time"...?
2013-11-10 15:23:29	@J	not sure if you can create it
2013-11-10 15:23:37	Espyo	not sure if that's what elasticity is
2013-11-10 15:23:40	@J	but you can test for it with isinf()
2013-11-10 15:23:54	@J	and there's no infinite for ints
2013-11-10 15:24:22	@J	that is what elasticity is
2013-11-10 15:24:58	@J	elasticity is the ratio of separation speed after collision to approach speed before collision
2013-11-10 15:25:03	@J	1 means no change in relative speed
2013-11-10 15:25:13	@J	0 means they end up at the same speed
2013-11-10 15:25:23	@J	2 means they bounce off with more energy than they started with
2013-11-10 15:25:30	Espyo	ah right
2013-11-10 15:25:37	Espyo	I was thinking of something more persistent
2013-11-10 15:25:43	Espyo	like the more you hit, the bouncier it gets
2013-11-10 15:25:44	@J	?
2013-11-10 15:25:46	Espyo	never mind
2013-11-10 15:25:48	@J	mm
2013-11-10 15:26:15	@J	well, if you let a ball fall onto a surface, the height it bounce back up to will be the same with e=1
2013-11-10 15:26:25	@J	with e>1, it gets higher and higher with tim
2013-11-10 15:26:26	@J	e
2013-11-10 15:26:45	Espyo	of course
2013-11-10 15:26:56	Espyo	but that's not really the concept I was (wrongly) thinking
2013-11-10 15:27:41	@J	okay, stuff seems to work much better now
2013-11-10 15:27:58	@J	I'm getting absolutely no infinite loops, and very few collisions at all with high elasticity
2013-11-10 15:28:04	Espyo	great
2013-11-10 15:28:12	@J	with e=0, I get some pretty large numbers of collisions
2013-11-10 15:28:29	@J	but it's probably many few orders of magnitude better than before I introduced grouping
2013-11-10 15:28:37	Espyo	yeah
2013-11-10 15:28:38	@J	and I have an idea for a further fix
2013-11-10 15:29:01	@J	then I need to go back and work out why the detection phase runs so much slower now
2013-11-10 15:29:08	@J	and it should be good
2013-11-10 15:31:40	Espyo	so, the code for that is currently filled with patches and hacks, yeah?
2013-11-10 15:35:45	@J	detection, not so much
2013-11-10 15:35:54	@J	http://i.imgur.com/95eBhzI.png
2013-11-10 15:36:01	@J	that's the sort of situation it still struggles with
2013-11-10 15:36:05	@J	with e=0
2013-11-10 15:36:06	@J	u
2013-11-10 15:36:12	@J	oops
2013-11-10 15:38:45	Espyo	that image doesn't tell me a great deal
2013-11-10 15:41:19	@J	okay, bad things still happen
2013-11-10 15:41:34	@J	friction is messed up again
2013-11-10 15:41:40	@J	things just move on their own
2013-11-10 15:42:02	@J	I still have work to do
2013-11-10 15:42:09	Espyo	eesh
2013-11-10 15:43:13	@J	ah, I think friction is in the wrong direction in collisions with static objects
2013-11-10 15:43:23	@J	so things speed up instead of slowing down
2013-11-10 15:44:01	@J	...and it's direction-dependent
2013-11-10 15:44:15	@J	the ceiling and left wall work, the floor and right wall don't
2013-11-10 15:46:47	@J	ugh, forgot to abs() something
2013-11-10 15:52:02	@J	oh, the image was just meant to show how many collisions are going on
2013-11-10 15:52:06	@J	big clusters of objects
2013-11-10 16:02:28	Espyo	ah

2013-11-10 20:56:25	Espyo	ok, I wrote code to make leaders auto-pluck Pikmin
2013-11-10 20:56:33	Espyo	and I bet a lot of things are going to go horribly wrong
2013-11-10 20:57:23	@PikFan	trial and error
2013-11-10 20:59:35	Espyo	yep
2013-11-10 21:01:42	@J	I can imagine going in a random order, trying to pluck non-buried Pikmin, standing in completely the wrong place but managing to pluck them anyway...
2013-11-10 21:03:36	Espyo	I doubt the random order bit and non-burrowed
2013-11-10 21:03:40	Espyo	but the rest I can totally believe it
2013-11-10 21:03:44	Espyo	hmm... buried or burrowed?
2013-11-10 21:04:32	Espyo	...well
2013-11-10 21:04:37	Espyo	I became stuck, and after a bit, it crashed
2013-11-10 21:07:40	Espyo	it...
2013-11-10 21:07:42	Espyo	looks like it's working
2013-11-10 21:08:09	Espyo	and because of your suggestion some days ago of using vectors instead of angles, a mob isn't considered to be in its destination right away, only after around half a second
2013-11-10 21:08:16	Espyo	so there's a beautiful delay between each pluck
2013-11-10 21:08:33	Espyo	well, what's /really/ going to break everything is 2 leaders, I can already tell
2013-11-10 21:12:59	@J	I don't remember suggesting that
2013-11-10 21:13:35	Espyo	you did
2013-11-10 21:13:45	Espyo	a mob wants to go towards a certain point
2013-11-10 21:14:00	@J	maybe
2013-11-10 21:14:00	Espyo	I was checking the angle and making it move in that direction, as per its speed
2013-11-10 21:14:08	Espyo	but I had troubles with when it reached its spot
2013-11-10 21:14:25	@J	don't really see why it'd cause this delay
2013-11-10 21:14:50	Espyo	I really can't see why either, it's bizarre

2013-11-12 20:21:48	@J	I'm getting to the point where I'm considering giving up on this physics engine
2013-11-12 20:22:07	@J	or, at least, giving up on doing it without learning how to do it
2013-11-12 20:24:34	Espyo	right
2013-11-12 20:24:42	Espyo	people use external engines all the time for a reason
2013-11-12 20:31:49	@J	I still want something simple to integrate with my game engine
2013-11-12 20:32:08	@J	simple as in, it doesn't need rotation
2013-11-12 20:40:08	Espyo	doesn't need rotation...
2013-11-12 20:40:20	Espyo	working on a rotated axis, you mean?
2013-11-12 20:49:29	@J	I guess
2013-11-12 20:50:05	@J	doesn't need rotation from a specific set of axes
2013-11-12 21:02:09	@J	the main issue is, with the grouping, even though the groups' centres of mass are separating at the end of collision resolution,
2013-11-12 21:02:23	@J	it doesn't mean the objects that actually collided are separating
2013-11-12 21:02:34	Espyo	yeah
2013-11-12 21:03:04	@J	it's possible to detect such cases, but then I lose all the advantages of grouping
2013-11-12 21:03:40	@J	I'll still look into the exact situations that are occurring for a little while
2013-11-12 21:03:48	@J	but I'm not sure I'll be able to come to a good solution
2013-11-12 21:05:16	Espyo	you might end up having to see how it's done
2013-11-12 21:05:20	Espyo	have you ever seen grouping done anywhere else?
2013-11-12 21:05:27	Espyo	or was it your idea?

2013-11-12 21:11:36	@J	normally engines let stuff move, then resolve collisions

2013-11-12 21:11:41	@J	I resolve collisions as they happen

2013-11-12 23:41:09	@PikFan	so I have 2,736,003,703,972,409 cookies in Cookie Clicker
2013-11-12 23:41:14	@PikFan	in the bank
2013-11-12 23:41:32	@PikFan	left the game running while I was at school
2013-11-12 23:41:48	Espyo	I just leave it running all day while the computer ison
2013-11-12 23:41:50	Espyo	*is on
2013-11-12 23:41:58	@PikFan	...but this is my mom's laptop
2013-11-12 23:42:52	Espyo	right, I know
2013-11-12 23:42:53	Espyo	just saying
2013-11-12 23:43:00	@PikFan	so popped all the wrinklers and they gave ~100,000,000,000,000 cookies each
2013-11-12 23:43:17	Espyo	pretty good
2013-11-12 23:43:19	@PikFan	hm
2013-11-12 23:43:36	@PikFan	should I buy the CpS upgrades or more antimatter condensers?
2013-11-12 23:43:59	@PikFan	got 69 antimatter condensers
2013-11-12 23:44:40	Espyo	the upgrades
2013-11-12 23:44:44	Espyo	the antimatter condensers have time
2013-11-12 23:44:52	@PikFan	okay
2013-11-12 23:45:11	@PikFan	hm
2013-11-12 23:45:26	@PikFan	CpS only increased by ~2,000,000,000
2013-11-12 23:46:11	Espyo	hmm
2013-11-12 23:46:20	Espyo	well, try to see how much it increases with an AC next
2013-11-12 23:46:24	Espyo	I think upgrades are a bit better
2013-11-12 23:46:43	@PikFan	increased by ~400,000,000
2013-11-12 23:47:06	@PikFan	okay, now I have 77 ACs
2013-11-12 23:47:12	@PikFan	heh, 77
2013-11-12 23:47:45	@PikFan	now I'm half-tempted to reset my game and get all the heavenly chips
2013-11-12 23:50:53	Espyo	well, there's your answer then
2013-11-12 23:50:56	Espyo	upgrades are better
2013-11-12 23:51:14	Espyo	when I first reset, with a lot of them, I got
2013-11-12 23:51:18	Espyo	...3 heavenly chips
2013-11-12 23:51:18	Espyo	or so
2013-11-12 23:51:23	@PikFan	heh
2013-11-12 23:51:35	Espyo	I think I chose a horrible time to reset, a time in which the creator decided to severely nerf them
2013-11-12 23:51:42	Espyo	I had no idea how they worked, hadn't checked wikia yet
2013-11-12 23:52:01	Espyo	but a friend of mine, who hasn't been playing for more than a week than me, told me at the time that he had a lot of heavenly chips
2013-11-12 23:52:01	@PikFan	1st reset I got 0 HCs because I didn't know that the first one needed 1,000,000,000,000 cookies
2013-11-12 23:52:01	Testyo	1 st = 6.3503 kg / 14 lb / 224 oz
2013-11-12 23:52:09	Espyo	so I assumed that with the amount I had, I'd get at least 100...
2013-11-12 23:52:16	Espyo	hmm
2013-11-12 23:52:30	@PikFan	because I reset with only like 200,000,000,000 cookies
2013-11-12 23:52:41	@PikFan	2nd reset, I got 37 HCs
2013-11-12 23:53:01	@PikFan	and with this reset that number is going to triple
2013-11-12 23:55:17	@PikFan	hmmmm
2013-11-12 23:55:36	@PikFan	I think I'll wait to reset so I can get the How? achievement
2013-11-12 23:55:45	Espyo	what's that one?
2013-11-12 23:56:05	@PikFan	where you have 10,000,000,000,000,000 cookies in the bank
2013-11-12 23:56:14	Espyo	ah
2013-11-12 23:56:20	@PikFan	wait, no
2013-11-12 23:56:42	@PikFan	I meant... that number of cookies baked in this game
2013-11-12 23:56:54	@PikFan	my mind is arguing with itself
2013-11-12 23:57:13	Espyo	right
2013-11-12 23:58:00	@PikFan	but there's no way I could get the Let's never bake again achievement in this game
2013-11-12 23:58:23	@PikFan	I only have 31,000,000,000 CpS
2013-11-12 23:58:24	Espyo	heh yeah
2013-11-12 23:58:34	@PikFan	gonna need a lot of HCs
2013-11-12 23:59:25	@PikFan	but I think I'll be able to get the Ruler of the ancients achievements
2013-11-12 23:59:30	@PikFan	I have 190 grandmas
2013-11-12 23:59:34	@PikFan	soooo close to 200
2013-11-13 00:01:00	Espyo	focus on them
2013-11-13 00:01:08	Espyo	because having them opens an achievement, so more CpS
2013-11-13 00:01:20	@PikFan	yeah
2013-11-13 00:01:22	Espyo	in addition to the CpS gained by buying the grandmas
2013-11-13 00:01:27	@PikFan	already have all the kitten upgrades
2013-11-13 00:02:27	@PikFan	uh
2013-11-13 00:02:44	@PikFan	you wouldn't happen to know the price of the 200th grandma, would you?
2013-11-13 00:02:50	Espyo	no
2013-11-13 00:02:54	@PikFan	:|
2013-11-13 00:02:59	Espyo	though I have 208
2013-11-13 00:03:02	Espyo	and the next one costs...

2013-11-14 14:22:31	Testyo	Hi everyone!
2013-11-14 18:42:04	@J	.
2013-11-14 18:42:29	Espyo	hey
2013-11-14 18:42:40	Espyo	so my laptop's screen doesn't display anything this time
2013-11-14 18:42:53	Espyo	so far, I could just bend the lid a bit and it'd work
2013-11-14 18:42:58	Espyo	but this time /nothing/ works
2013-11-14 18:47:17	@J	what are you using now/
2013-11-14 18:47:18	@J	*?
2013-11-14 18:47:54	Espyo	an external monitor
2013-11-14 18:47:58	Espyo	my huge living room TV
2013-11-14 18:48:19	Espyo	I'll send it for repair, because I cannot for the life of me open it
2013-11-14 18:48:27	@J	'open'?
2013-11-14 18:48:29	Espyo	I mean, I don't even know what the problem is, but
2013-11-14 18:48:31	Espyo	the laptop
2013-11-14 18:48:40	@J	oh, you mean unscrew stuff
2013-11-14 18:48:44	Espyo	I was hoping I'd open it and figure out what's up, possibly the other end of the tap being loose
2013-11-14 18:48:46	Espyo	yeah
2013-11-14 18:48:52	Espyo	I get to a point where I just can't go on
2013-11-14 18:48:52	@J	hmm
2013-11-14 18:49:03	Espyo	nothing left to unscrew, the next step everyone says is to remove the keyboard
2013-11-14 18:49:09	Espyo	but I am very sure that's completely impossible
2013-11-14 18:49:11	@J	try looking up manufacturer's docs for your model
2013-11-14 18:49:17	@J	they might give detail
2013-11-14 18:49:17	@J	s
2013-11-14 18:49:21	Espyo	even though the guy on the video does exactly that with exactly my model
2013-11-14 18:49:26	@J	hmm
2013-11-14 18:49:41	Espyo	if I went further, I'd remove the keyboard
2013-11-14 18:49:42	@J	well, sending it for repair will probably cost a lot, won't it?
2013-11-14 18:49:43	Espyo	but it'd be by force
2013-11-14 18:49:44	Espyo	so...
2013-11-14 18:49:55	Espyo	we're sending it to someone who's kind of a friend
2013-11-14 18:49:59	@J	mm, I see
2013-11-14 18:50:00	Espyo	more like an acquaintance
2013-11-14 18:50:06	Espyo	won't cost as much
2013-11-14 18:50:12	@J	you might just find out it's broken anyway
2013-11-14 18:50:16	Espyo	yeah
2013-11-14 18:50:22	Espyo	but we have to do something
2013-11-14 18:50:31	Espyo	during the next few days, I'll be using my sister's craptop
2013-11-14 18:50:35	Espyo	I'll still come on IRC and such
2013-11-14 18:50:41	Espyo	but all my projects and tools are on my laptop
2013-11-14 18:50:46	Espyo	which means I'll be doing something else
2013-11-14 18:50:56	@J	semi-related: I heard there's a screen on kickstarter
2013-11-14 18:50:57	Espyo	which means I'm going to completely destroy you on our Pikipedia ToDo competition
2013-11-14 18:51:14	@J	something like 16:9 720px high, 9 inches across the diagonal
2013-11-14 18:51:14	Testyo	9 inches = 22.86 cm
2013-11-14 18:51:23	Espyo	I saw /something/ on Kickstarter today
2013-11-14 18:51:29	Espyo	didn't pay attention to what it was
2013-11-14 18:51:44	Espyo	hmm
2013-11-14 18:51:49	@J	not entirely sure myself, just someone at work mentioned
2013-11-14 18:51:50	@J	it
2013-11-14 18:51:57	Espyo	but I see guys in college with screens like that on their smaller laptops
2013-11-14 18:52:03	Espyo	or maybe I'm thinking of something else...
2013-11-14 18:52:11	@J	well, this is just a standalone screen
2013-11-14 18:52:12	@J	HDMI
2013-11-14 18:52:24	Espyo	oh
2013-11-14 18:52:26	@J	you could use it with a small ARM computer, for example
2013-11-14 18:52:31	@J	it's portable
2013-11-14 18:52:46	@J	or just set it up as some sort of display on your desk for monitoring stuff
2013-11-14 18:52:49	@J	I don't know
2013-11-14 18:53:12	@J	the guy at work was thinking about mounting it on the quadcopter he's built
2013-11-14 18:54:34	Espyo	quadcopter?
2013-11-14 18:55:09	@J	helicopter with 4 sets of blades
2013-11-14 18:55:35	Espyo	ok, but I don't see how that's...
2013-11-14 18:55:45	Espyo	he wants to mount a screen on a
2013-11-14 18:55:55	Espyo	wait, an actual helicopter?
2013-11-14 18:56:18	@J	small thing
2013-11-14 18:56:30	@J	40cm across?
2013-11-14 18:56:30	Testyo	40 cm = 15.752 in / 1.312 ft / 21.0526 Olimar-heights
2013-11-14 18:56:50	Espyo	I had no idea people could just /own/ helicopters
2013-11-14 18:57:06	Espyo	...
2013-11-14 18:57:11	Espyo	so it's not an actual drivable thing
2013-11-14 18:57:15	Espyo	I read that as 40m at first
2013-11-14 18:57:16	Testyo	40 m = 43.744 yd / 131.232 ft / 2105.26 Olimar-heights
2013-11-14 18:57:19	@J	not with a person in it, no
2013-11-14 18:57:21	Espyo	it was really messing with my mind
2013-11-14 18:57:57	Espyo	I suppose the Kickstarter is to find ways to make these screens cheaply accessible
2013-11-14 19:21:07	Espyo	http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2011/03/every-character-from-nintendos-pikmin-games-recreated-in-lego/ wow
2013-11-14 19:21:12	Espyo	the guy even did the WW bugs
2013-11-14 19:30:38	@J	hmm, I've seen some of these but I never knew where they came from
2013-11-14 19:35:40	Espyo	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxUF1eV8WlE pffthaha
2013-11-14 19:37:50	Espyo	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GducB8e9mQ0 what?!
2013-11-14 19:39:34	@J	how did that even happen
2013-11-14 19:40:34	Espyo	it looks like a Yellow might've thrown its bomb-rock
2013-11-14 19:40:46	Espyo	packed full of invisible boomness
2013-11-14 19:42:25	@J	I meant the first one
2013-11-14 19:42:35	@J	but that too, I guess
2013-11-14 19:42:43	Espyo	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuArmGrgb68 new glitch to add to the article
2013-11-14 19:42:49	Espyo	it's not really a glitch, but eh
2013-11-14 20:02:01	Espyo	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4EffSBL2GU what IS this black magic
2013-11-14 20:06:56	Espyo	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=farjeBvZphc ok, this explains it

2013-11-15 19:31:38	@J	don't you remember sending those to me for me to upload them?
2013-11-15 19:31:43	Espyo	but I get it, from context
2013-11-15 19:31:49	Espyo	I
2013-11-15 19:31:57	Espyo	but you uploaded that before I ripped them
2013-11-15 19:32:07	Espyo	and I did share it, but it was just for show, I had plans of uploading them myself
2013-11-15 19:33:22	Espyo	well, shower time
2013-11-15 19:33:29	@J	you already ripped them years ago
2013-11-15 19:36:49	@J	well, turns out that's a lie

2013-11-15 20:19:06	Espyo	maybe the server's slowing you down because you're sending too many requests

2013-11-15 20:20:06	Espyo	wow
2013-11-15 20:21:46	Espyo	ok, searching for Pikmin 2 glitches on Google doesn't give much
2013-11-15 20:21:46	Espyo	at all
2013-11-15 20:21:55	Espyo	by page 3, the results start to wander off

2013-11-15 20:22:15	Espyo	I'll have better luck on youtube

2013-11-15 20:23:51	Espyo	pikmin glitches -"pikmin 3" looks like it works wonderfully
2013-11-15 20:24:02	@J	no, but it depends if you're trying to find every page ever with a glitch on it, or to find some glitches without wasting all your time
2013-11-15 20:24:25	@J	I didn't know you could do that, sounds good
2013-11-15 20:24:35	Espyo	I'd like to find glitches only a few people know about, so we can add those 'cause we're missing
2013-11-15 20:24:44	Espyo	but if only a few people know about, it must be deep
2013-11-15 20:25:06	Espyo	I never tried such a query before, but I assumed that it'd work

2013-11-16 23:58:50	@PikFan	I'm wondering if DonoPik is lying just to get attention

2013-11-17 13:17:36	Testyo	Hi everyone!
2013-11-17 13:25:25	Espyo	how neat
2013-11-17 13:25:49	Espyo	my wikia account is set to Portuguese
2013-11-17 13:25:53	Espyo	then I went to an article
2013-11-17 13:25:58	Espyo	and the index said "Innehåll [visa]"
2013-11-17 13:26:03	Espyo	which is nowhere near Portuguese
2013-11-17 13:26:13	Espyo	beautiful job, wikia, no doubt about it
2013-11-17 13:26:14	Espyo	 10/10

2013-11-17 14:19:33	Espyo	whatever it is, it's so very wrong
2013-11-17 16:38:53	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:Title
2013-11-17 16:38:56	Espyo	I must be going nuts here
2013-11-17 16:39:05	Espyo	can you change the bottom two lines to a smaller font?
2013-11-17 16:39:18	Espyo	I tried doing it, but either some horrible glitch is taking place, or I completely forgot how to HTML
2013-11-17 16:39:23	Espyo	and I did NOT forget how to HTML
2013-11-17 16:50:26	@J	use {{=}} for the =
2013-11-17 16:51:58	Espyo	..........
2013-11-17 16:53:55	Espyo	much better now
2013-11-17 16:54:07	Espyo	I think using {{box|1=... would also work
2013-11-17 16:54:21	Espyo	at least it does when people put videos on ToDo tags on TCRF
2013-11-17 17:05:02	@J	hmm, possibly
2013-11-17 17:08:15	Espyo	pffft
2013-11-17 17:08:38	Espyo	Testyo conveniently told the network notice that 800km equals...

2013-11-17 19:53:38	Espyo	hey
2013-11-17 19:54:02	Espyo	so I went on a page on Carmageddon wikia today (I really have to move that out of wikia)
2013-11-17 19:54:09	Espyo	my wikia is set to Portuguese
2013-11-17 19:54:13	Espyo	everything was fine in Portuguese
2013-11-17 19:54:34	Espyo	except for the index in the page, which had "Innehåll [visa]"
2013-11-17 19:54:41	Espyo	 13:58	J	that looks like some sort of Scandinavian
2013-11-17 19:54:52	Espyo	I have no idea what it is, could be anything as far as I know
2013-11-17 19:54:55	Espyo	but it's nowhere near Portuguese
2013-11-17 19:55:03	Espyo	grade A job, bravo wikia
2013-11-17 20:10:42	@J	hey PikFan 
2013-11-17 20:10:47	@PikFan	hi J
2013-11-17 20:11:02	@J	so...is it normal to run inside?
2013-11-17 20:11:11	@J	I mean, when going between rooms, just running to save time
2013-11-17 20:11:14	@J	or something
2013-11-17 20:11:15	Espyo	depends
2013-11-17 20:11:22	Espyo	...running inside
2013-11-17 20:11:28	Espyo	what are you doing
2013-11-17 20:11:34	Espyo	you should obviously be side-jumping
2013-11-17 20:11:35	@PikFan	running inside if you're playing with someone
2013-11-17 20:11:37	Espyo	specially to save time
2013-11-17 20:11:43	Espyo	it's so much faster to side-jump
2013-11-17 20:11:47	@PikFan	but
2013-11-17 20:11:54	@PikFan	side-jumps are not possible
2013-11-17 20:12:02	@PikFan	they only exist in video games
2013-11-17 20:12:05	Espyo	they are, except they cause a lot of broken ankles
2013-11-17 20:12:16	@PikFan	therefore they are not possible
2013-11-17 20:12:26	@PikFan	er...
2013-11-17 20:12:37	Espyo	seriously now, though, I don't run inside the house, but I like holding on to the frame of my bed (right to my left) and propel myself when I want to leave my chair
2013-11-17 20:12:40	@PikFan	not possible w/o getting broken ankles, that is
2013-11-17 20:13:27	@J	I see
2013-11-17 20:13:32	@J	well, I wasn't suggesting I do so
2013-11-17 20:13:33	@J	or anything
2013-11-17 20:13:49	@PikFan	also J, Testyo made a paradox
2013-11-17 20:14:28	@PikFan	he said we had to unscramble the word flow
2013-11-17 20:14:33	@PikFan	but flow is a word
2013-11-17 20:15:37	@J	yeah, we established Testyo's silliness earlier today
2013-11-17 20:15:54	@PikFan	hm?
2013-11-17 20:26:22	@J	[17:08:15] Espyo pffft
2013-11-17 20:26:22	@J	[17:08:38] Espyo Testyo conveniently told the network notice that 800km equals...
2013-11-17 20:26:22	@J	[17:08:38] Testyo 800 km = 497.12 mi
2013-11-17 20:26:22	@J	[17:08:40] Espyo that

2013-11-17 20:26:23	Testyo	800 km = 497.12 mi
2013-11-17 20:26:26	@J	...
2013-11-17 20:45:18	@PikFan	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Rubble
2013-11-17 20:45:32	@PikFan	in Pikmin 1, it doesn't specifically list where they're at
2013-11-17 20:46:05	@PikFan	oh, and does anyone know if nectar weed/rubble are in Pikmin 3?
2013-11-17 20:48:16	Espyo	I'll ask
2013-11-17 20:48:24	Espyo	I'm on Skype right now with someone who's playing Pikmin 3 right now
2013-11-17 20:48:35	@PikFan	okay
2013-11-17 20:48:49	@PikFan	and I noticed that there was a rubble missing from the WW
2013-11-17 20:49:00	Espyo	he says no rubble
2013-11-17 20:49:03	Espyo	nor nectar weed, actually
2013-11-17 20:49:08	Espyo	nectar comes only from eggs and a certain enemy
2013-11-17 20:49:12	Espyo	(also I think he forgot 
2013-11-17 20:49:20	Espyo	*Flint Beetles, but that's neither here nor there)
2013-11-17 20:49:27	@PikFan	yeah, the Nectarous Dandelfly
2013-11-17 21:00:10	Espyo	PikFan: got a moment to test a glitch?
2013-11-17 21:00:20	@PikFan	sure, which game?
2013-11-17 21:00:35	Espyo	you have NPC!P2, right?
2013-11-17 21:00:38	@PikFan	mhm
2013-11-17 21:01:09	Espyo	ok, so wikia claims that the instant extinction glitch doesn't work in NPC!
2013-11-17 21:01:37	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Glitches_in_Pikmin_2#Instant_Pikmin_extinction
2013-11-17 21:01:42	Espyo	I want you to please verify that cliam
2013-11-17 21:01:43	Espyo	*claim
2013-11-17 21:01:52	Espyo	should be easy to pull off if it works
2013-11-17 21:02:00	Espyo	I got it after trying like 10-15 times, one minute
2013-11-17 21:03:04	@PikFan	oh, done this before on GCN
2013-11-17 21:03:12	@PikFan	but haven't tried it on Wii...
2013-11-17 21:03:23	@PikFan	okay, I'll test it
2013-11-17 21:07:24	Espyo	also test some other glitches that have an unknown check for NPC!, please
2013-11-17 21:08:47	@PikFan	confirmed
2013-11-17 21:08:52	@PikFan	it is possible
2013-11-17 21:10:19	Espyo	sweet
2013-11-17 21:10:21	Espyo	wikia is wrong again
2013-11-17 21:10:25	Espyo	as usual
2013-11-17 21:20:44	@PikFan	any other glitch you want me to check?
2013-11-17 21:21:11	@PikFan	because I think /all/ the NPC! glitches have a ? next to them
2013-11-17 21:22:01	Espyo	I think so too...
2013-11-17 21:22:04	Espyo	so... all?
2013-11-17 21:22:17	Espyo	well, mostly the minor ones, I suppose
2013-11-17 21:22:26	Espyo	so you don't have to start new save files to test some of those, like the scales glitch
2013-11-17 21:22:38	@PikFan	pretty sure that double sprays is a given
2013-11-17 21:24:57	Espyo	dunno

2013-11-18 22:49:15	@J	I should really bother looking further into getting a new computer
2013-11-18 22:50:22	Espyo	yep
2013-11-18 22:50:27	Espyo	luckily I don't have to worry
2013-11-18 22:50:35	Espyo	there's not enough money to even think about a new one
2013-11-18 22:52:42	@J	well, as everyone knows, as soon as you get a job you're instantly rich
2013-11-18 22:52:46	@J	so I should be fine
2013-11-18 22:52:56	Espyo	true, true
2013-11-18 22:53:04	Espyo	I can't remember if I said before
2013-11-18 22:53:06	Espyo	I must've
2013-11-18 22:53:18	Espyo	but lately so many people are having disk problems, that I can't remember who I said what, but...
2013-11-18 22:53:35	Espyo	have you been moving the laptop a lot while the disk was being accessed?
2013-11-18 22:53:41	Espyo	#1 cause for disk failures, it seems
2013-11-18 22:53:45	Espyo	and it's more common than not
2013-11-18 22:54:55	@J	no
2013-11-18 22:54:59	@J	I never move it
2013-11-18 22:55:35	@J	I guess I'm just unlucky with disks - this is already the 2nd one in this laptop
2013-11-18 22:55:46	@J	though I guess it's a couple of years old now
2013-11-18 22:56:52	Espyo	really weird then
2013-11-18 22:59:13	@J	also, I thought of a new game idea today
2013-11-18 22:59:37	@J	a simple top-down fighting game based around teleportation
2013-11-18 22:59:42	Espyo	I keep mine on a text file
2013-11-18 22:59:52	Espyo	I actually sent it to you once, you thought I was joking hah
2013-11-18 22:59:56	Espyo	ssssssssss
2013-11-18 22:59:59	Espyo	...this s key
2013-11-18 23:00:03	Espyo	just... ignore that, I guess
2013-11-18 23:00:08	@J	you sent me what?
2013-11-18 23:00:14	Espyo	hmm, top-down fighting game
2013-11-18 23:00:21	Espyo	a text file where I keep all my game ideas
2013-11-18 23:00:35	@J	you can't move normally, and you hold down a button while moving to charge a teleport
2013-11-18 23:00:43	Espyo	started my firsssssst message too abruptly, my bad
2013-11-18 23:00:47	Espyo	this S KEY
2013-11-18 23:00:56	@J	when you release it, you move quickly, but it's not a real teleport so it's not instant
2013-11-18 23:01:07	Espyo	maybe that would distract too much from the fighting aspect
2013-11-18 23:01:09	Espyo	but maybe not
2013-11-18 23:01:10	@J	and you also have a short-range attack you can aim in any direction
2013-11-18 23:01:15	Espyo	this is one of those things that needs a proto and playtesting
2013-11-18 23:01:18	@J	yep
2013-11-18 23:01:27	@J	there are things I need to think through, like
2013-11-18 23:01:37	Espyo	and because it's top-down, you could probably have neat non-linear stages
2013-11-18 23:01:38	@J	can you cancel mid-move?
2013-11-18 23:01:51	Espyo	right, several things need to be thought about well
2013-11-18 23:01:53	@J	what about obstacles - spikes, walls, pits you can move over but not stop on
2013-11-18 23:01:56	Espyo	it is a fighter, after all
2013-11-18 23:02:28	@J	when you charge a teleport, do you visibly move in the direction you're holding, but very slowly, so that your opponent can tell where you'll move if they pay attention?
2013-11-18 23:02:28	Espyo	sounds like a good candidate for a fast-paced fighting game, instead of slow and more controlled
2013-11-18 23:02:39	@J	also hopefully very mind-gamey
2013-11-18 23:02:57	Espyo	if you can curve while the teleport is happening, that would be incredible
2013-11-18 23:02:57	@J	it could definitely be slow because of the charge time
2013-11-18 23:03:04	@J	yeah, that's exactly what I meant
2013-11-18 23:03:08	Espyo	yay
2013-11-18 23:03:14	@J	you draw out a path while charging, then you follow the path very quickl
2013-11-18 23:03:16	@J	y
2013-11-18 23:03:18	Espyo	there shouldn't be indicators that the teleport is being charged
2013-11-18 23:03:20	@J	and you can attack while moving
2013-11-18 23:03:32	Espyo	I was thinking drawing the path as you went, but I like that idea
2013-11-18 23:03:36	@J	yeah, I thought that at first, but then I began to think it might add something
2013-11-18 23:03:46	Espyo	wonder how well it'd work; the opponent could telegraph your path planning before you released
2013-11-18 23:03:49	Espyo	again, playtesting
2013-11-18 23:04:02	@J	just being able to tell your direction at any point, but not the whole path unless you paid attention and remembered it
2013-11-18 23:04:10	Espyo	hmm
2013-11-18 23:04:23	Espyo	but I'm imagining a teleport-dash-thing lasting around half a second
2013-11-18 23:04:25	@J	and there's the nice learning curve of getting the timing down
2013-11-18 23:04:29	Espyo	and only covering about 4 character-widths
2013-11-18 23:04:44	Espyo	not much space or time to do crazy paths
2013-11-18 23:04:50	Espyo	at least the way I'm envisioning it
2013-11-18 23:04:56	@J	I'm not sure if I'd limit distance, or just make it so you go as far as you held down the button for
2013-11-18 23:05:13	Espyo	heh, there'd have to be a cap
2013-11-18 23:05:18	@J	I don't like the idea of a set distance - you can't really choose where you end up
2013-11-18 23:05:43	@J	and if there is a cap, does it force you to move at the end of the time, or only when you let go of the button?
2013-11-18 23:05:52	Espyo	hm yeah, but there /has/ to be at least a time cap
2013-11-18 23:06:07	@J	if the latter, you could do some extra wiggles once it's done to throw off your component, if there's that mechanic
2013-11-18 23:06:11	Espyo	or else you could hold for most of the match, and then stay teleporting the rest of the match, to go all the way until a timeout
2013-11-18 23:06:13	@J	*opponent
2013-11-18 23:06:16	@J	what was that even
2013-11-18 23:06:29	Espyo	>I'm not sure if I'd limit distance, or just make it so you go as far as you held down the button for
2013-11-18 23:06:34	Espyo	>held down the button for
2013-11-18 23:06:52	Espyo	I was thinking that if you hold "charge teleport" for 2 seconds, when you release, you teleport for 2 seconds... or something
2013-11-18 23:06:53	@J	mm, it kind of works - I was thinking in multiple tenses
2013-11-18 23:06:59	Espyo	teleport time is fixed, then?
2013-11-18 23:07:03	@J	no
2013-11-18 23:07:04	@J	wait
2013-11-18 23:07:07	@J	I'm confused
2013-11-18 23:07:14	Espyo	getting a bit confused as well
2013-11-18 23:07:25	Espyo	ok, o we're both not thinking of fixed teleportation timed
2013-11-18 23:07:34	@J	my idea was something like, you hold down the button for 2 seconds, then your movement takes .2s
2013-11-18 23:07:40	@J	hold for 3s, you take .3s
2013-11-18 23:07:51	Espyo	I have to attempt surgery on thi S key, gimme a ssec
2013-11-18 23:08:06	@J	if you could hold forever, and you tried it, you'd probably get killed quickly
2013-11-18 23:08:41	@J	what did you mean by nonlinear stages?
2013-11-18 23:08:56	Espyo	sssssssssxwzwxgeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeegwhat is this, glued here?
2013-11-18 23:09:08	Espyo	yeah, 3 hold -> .3 teleport sounds good

2013-11-18 23:09:23	Espyo	started thinking that after what I said before
2013-11-18 23:10:49	@J	anyway, I'll work on it
2013-11-18 23:10:52	@J	at some point
2013-11-18 23:10:52	Espyo	dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
2013-11-18 23:10:55	Espyo	good luck
2013-11-18 23:10:59	Espyo	now you need time
2013-11-18 23:11:09	@J	I still want to make that racing game some day
2013-11-18 23:11:20	@J	the one with absorbing and expelling force from crashes
2013-11-18 23:11:25	Espyo	sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssddssssssassssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
2013-11-18 23:11:27	Espyo	oh yeah, that one
2013-11-18 23:11:37	Espyo	ok, I think I fixed the S key
2013-11-18 23:11:43	Espyo	why didn't my sister ask me to try this before?
2013-11-18 23:11:46	Espyo	gotta ask her now
2013-11-18 23:12:34	Espyo	*shrug*
2013-11-18 23:12:53	Espyo	I had an idea the other day as well... let me see if I can bring it back
2013-11-18 23:14:19	Espyo	pffffft
2013-11-18 23:14:27	Espyo	I see it now
2013-11-18 23:14:35	Espyo	it's really stupid how the idea came to be
2013-11-18 23:14:55	Espyo	one day, I was getting ready for bed
2013-11-18 23:15:10	Espyo	I had one leg on the bed, I think, and the sheets were covering it
2013-11-18 23:15:31	Espyo	instead of opening the sheets down to put my other leg in, I stretched the other leg to try to get it inside, even though the sheets were too high
2013-11-18 23:15:40	Espyo	I could swear I could pull it off, but nope
2013-11-18 23:15:50	Espyo	then I thought to myself "eesh, what? am I not agile any more?"
2013-11-18 23:15:59	Espyo	then suddenly my brain decided to formulate a game idea
2013-11-18 23:16:16	Espyo	a game in which you're a ninja, except one day you wake up and you're not a ninja anymore
2013-11-18 23:16:33	Espyo	gotta try to do stuff that's normally easy to ninjas, but awkward to now-normal you
2013-11-18 23:16:54	Espyo	...was I on drugs
2013-11-18 23:17:01	Espyo	because I just re-read what I wrote, and that can't be normal
2013-11-18 23:17:16	Espyo	either I was very sleep deprived, and the next day I decided to point down the idea, just in case
2013-11-18 23:17:21	Espyo	or I'm actually on to something great
2013-11-18 23:18:11	@J	what is that
2013-11-18 23:19:01	Espyo	what's what
2013-11-18 23:19:11	@J	that stuff you just wrote
2013-11-18 23:19:25	@J	I agree with the drugs
2013-11-18 23:19:27	Espyo	the process that lead up to the idea of a game I once had
2013-11-18 23:19:42	@J	well, sounds kind of like Octodad
2013-11-18 23:19:51	@J	potentially
2013-11-18 23:19:51	Espyo	I mean, I once had the idea to make the game, not owning the game
2013-11-18 23:19:57	Espyo	hmm
2013-11-18 23:20:08	Espyo	Octodad isn't so much about being stealthy as it is about being a normal dad
2013-11-18 23:20:23	Espyo	here you're kinda the other way around, you want to do ninja things, but with normal skills
2013-11-18 23:20:28	Espyo	also no tentacle controls, sadly
2013-11-18 23:23:30	@J	it's still about trying to do stuff you can't
2013-11-18 23:23:36	Espyo	true
2013-11-18 23:31:36	@J	I haven't really played many ninja games
2013-11-18 23:31:48	@J	there was a 2-player one where you're tied together by an elastic rope
2013-11-18 23:32:01	@J	and can cling to walls and stuff, to help each other around
2013-11-18 23:32:12	Espyo	sounds neat
2013-11-18 23:32:27	Espyo	hmm, I was just thinking wall-jumping, shuriken-throwing, and general stealth
2013-11-18 23:32:30	Espyo	maybe fast running
2013-11-18 23:32:45	Espyo	oh, and ceiling-clinging, a la Shinobi III
2013-11-18 23:33:51	@J	can't see how the normal human aspect would fit in, really
2013-11-18 23:34:03	@J	it'd just come across as you being kind of underpowered
2013-11-18 23:34:10	Espyo	I guess you'd still be agile
2013-11-18 23:34:16	Espyo	being a ninja is like magic
2013-11-18 23:34:29	Espyo	...look, I really have no idea, the idea is stupider the more I think about it
2013-11-18 23:34:33	Espyo	but I like it each time more
2013-11-18 23:34:56	Espyo	half puzzle, to get around
2013-11-18 23:35:05	Espyo	half awkward controls for otherwise easy things
2013-11-18 23:35:32	Espyo	like walljumping, instead of pressing jump on the wall, you have to like press against the wall, then smash against the opposite direction real fast and press jump at the same time
2013-11-18 23:35:41	Espyo	and then hold up to jump up or something
2013-11-18 23:35:56	Espyo	at least to make the game not boring, otherwise, I'd just make you take some nearby stairs
2013-11-18 23:36:08	Espyo	but it would quickly become a normal human stealth game
2013-11-18 23:36:13	Espyo	no mentions of ninjas whatsoever
2013-11-18 23:40:01	@J	hmm
2013-11-18 23:40:14	@J	that's an interesting idea: you could make it about subverting expectations
2013-11-18 23:40:26	Espyo	mhm, I was thinking a bit of that as well
2013-11-18 23:40:28	@J	so there's this wall to climb that seems like the obvious way forwards
2013-11-18 23:40:43	@J	but it's actually impossible to do it, and there are some stairs hidden nearby
2013-11-18 23:40:51	@J	that could be a thing
2013-11-18 23:40:54	Espyo	yeah
2013-11-18 23:41:06	Espyo	if only I could somehow showcase clearly how easy that would be to a ninja
2013-11-18 23:41:37	Espyo	I can't just rely on people's knowledge of walljumping
2013-11-18 23:41:47	Espyo	maybe an opponent ninja? a race of sorts?
2013-11-18 23:42:12	Espyo	I want to have an unlockable ninja mode after you finish it, but it wouldn't work to show how easy stuff is for ninjas during the first playthrough
2013-11-18 23:46:09	@J	monologue?
2013-11-18 23:46:37	@J	or you start off with such powers and then get amnesia or something?  (Think Metroid)
2013-11-18 23:46:46	Espyo	right
2013-11-18 23:46:56	Espyo	but that seems too linear, the powerup losing thing
2013-11-18 23:47:08	Espyo	the whole game'd have to be played for laughs
2013-11-18 23:47:13	Espyo	no way a game like this could be serious
2013-11-18 23:47:28	@J	yeah
2013-11-18 23:47:40	@J	in a cutscene, then?
2013-11-18 23:48:16	Espyo	maybe some combination of several of those things

2013-11-19 19:55:51	@J	beep
2013-11-19 20:01:36	Espyo	we should talk about game ideas more
2013-11-19 20:01:41	Espyo	because apparently that makes me dream of game ideas
2013-11-19 20:02:04	Espyo	I was playing an NES game with friends, a 3/4 view game, like Double Dragon, except a fighter
2013-11-19 20:02:12	Espyo	but the thing is, one of the characters was a tree
2013-11-19 20:02:28	Espyo	I had no idea what was so special about the tree, so I picked it
2013-11-19 20:02:54	Espyo	and realized that the trees in the level were like mine, so I concluded that the tree's thing is to blend in with the other trees and attack those who can't recognize you
2013-11-19 20:03:08	Espyo	and then the game went real-life, and I could shape-shift in real life
2013-11-19 20:03:12	Espyo	to more shapes than just the tree
2013-11-19 20:03:32	Espyo	too bad this concept already exists, it's a Half-Life mod, I think
2013-11-19 20:03:37	Espyo	but it isn't a fighter, so...
2013-11-19 20:14:33	@J	have you heard of Spy Party?
2013-11-19 20:19:49	Espyo	nope
2013-11-19 20:20:30	-->	BetaMaster64 (BetaMaster@c-521-44-23-901.hsd6.pa.comcast.net) has joined #pikipedia
2013-11-19 20:20:49	@J	one player moves around at a party, and the other is looking inside through a sniper rifle scope
2013-11-19 20:21:01	@J	and has to tell which guest is the other player by how they act
2013-11-19 20:23:17	Espyo	wow
2013-11-19 20:30:11	Espyo	I'm seeing some gameplay, looks amazing
2013-11-19 20:40:49	@J	I just mentioned it because there's a similar idea there
2013-11-19 20:41:23	@J	I always find it's good to look at games that are at all similar, so you can see how they solved any problems you come across
2013-11-19 20:41:29	Espyo	right
2013-11-19 20:41:45	Espyo	hmm, I know it's a beta, and an interesting idea, but $15 for a beta...
2013-11-19 20:41:46	Testyo	$ 15 = 11.058 € / £ 9.4575 
2013-11-19 20:41:57	Espyo	those models and animations look like they took 2 days each
2013-11-19 20:42:04	Espyo	the gameplay looks like it took a week to code
2013-11-19 20:42:10	Espyo	and in the end, $15 already...?
2013-11-19 20:42:10	Testyo	$ 15 = 11.058 € / £ 9.4575 
2013-11-19 20:42:25	Espyo	either my perception of profit is kinda generous, or the guy's greedy
2013-11-19 20:43:19	Espyo	oh, the official site has more updated images
2013-11-19 20:43:26	Espyo	well, I guess $15 works
2013-11-19 20:43:26	Testyo	$ 15 = 11.058 € / £ 9.4575 
2013-11-19 20:43:30	Espyo	I mean, it's playable as it is
2013-11-19 20:45:49	@J	I don't know, I only really saw it when it was first in development
2013-11-19 20:45:55	@J	I think it came out of a jam
2013-11-19 20:47:07	@J	but hey, you should know as well as anybody that the parts you don't see take 98% of the work
2013-11-19 20:49:33	Espyo	mhm, mhm
2013-11-19 20:53:55	Espyo	oh pfft
2013-11-19 20:54:06	Espyo	the Ludum Dare website has a TODO on its countdown
2013-11-19 20:54:11	Espyo	it's not set for daylight savings
2013-11-19 20:57:59	@J	...does that mean you're actually doing it this time?
2013-11-19 21:04:37	Espyo	I tried doing it the past 2 times
2013-11-19 21:04:42	Espyo	I've always had something stop me
2013-11-19 21:04:47	Espyo	personally, I want to see what's going to stop me this time
2013-11-19 21:06:23	@J	pessimism
2013-11-19 21:07:26	Espyo	realism
2013-11-19 21:07:27	Espyo	I want to
2013-11-19 21:07:30	Espyo	I really do
2013-11-19 21:10:06	@J	I mean pessimism is the thing that will stop you

2013-11-20 21:18:44	PikFan	okay, /why/ did DonoPik randomly make a new wiki
2013-11-20 21:18:52	PikFan	this is absured
2013-11-20 21:18:56	PikFan	*absurd
2013-11-20 21:21:08	PikFan	Espyo? J?
2013-11-20 21:22:01	Espyo	hey
2013-11-20 21:22:04	Espyo	because he's gone insane
2013-11-20 21:22:11	Espyo	Los_Plagas already warned him
2013-11-20 21:22:17	Espyo	but if he keeps going, I'm telling wikia
2013-11-20 21:22:28	Espyo	because, as it turns out, wikia's TOS aren't fond of duplicates
2013-11-20 21:23:27	PikFan	heh, there IS something good about wikia after all
2013-11-20 21:23:51	PikFan	also, I'm going to warn him on Fanon, because I've reached the conclusion he made a story up
2013-11-20 21:23:52	Espyo	well, duplicates of other wikias, at least
2013-11-20 21:24:03	Espyo	I bet they'd be fine with people copying existing out-of-wikia wikis
2013-11-20 21:24:07	--	AFK-DOS is now known as BetaMaster64
2013-11-20 21:24:10	Espyo	he made a story up?
2013-11-20 21:24:11	PikFan	checked recent changes, history, contribs... everything
2013-11-20 21:24:21	PikFan	yeah, about someone spamming his user talk
2013-11-20 21:24:44	PikFan	so I'm going to give him a warning
2013-11-20 21:25:12	Espyo	ok, check this out: http://static2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130624024614/pikmin/images/5/5f/Map_Awakening_Wood.png
2013-11-20 21:25:15	Espyo	that's a wikia pic
2013-11-20 21:25:21	Espyo	we're going to do something similar, it's on the todo already
2013-11-20 21:25:29	Espyo	(but ours will be better, of course)
2013-11-20 21:25:39	Espyo	now, what I want to bring to attention is the onion and ship icons
2013-11-20 21:25:47	Espyo	those are in the game's files as black and white textures
2013-11-20 21:25:55	Espyo	so to color them right, you have to go through a weird setup
2013-11-20 21:25:59	Espyo	which is what I did
2013-11-20 21:26:08	Espyo	me and Los_Plagas talked about this yesterday, and I was sure they stole from me
2013-11-20 21:26:20	Espyo	but now, looking at the exact colors
2013-11-20 21:26:43	Espyo	my yellow Onion has an orange of FF8000, whereas theirs has a FF8600 orange
2013-11-20 21:26:52	Espyo	subtle difference, but it proves they didn't steal it
2013-11-20 21:27:05	Espyo	that's good because at least they aren't stealing us
2013-11-20 21:27:13	Espyo	...but it's bad, because they have skilled people on their side

2013-11-21 21:56:04	@J	also that
2013-11-21 21:58:53	Espyo	because it's clearly some dolt trying to self-glorify himself by having a wiki all to himself, out of other people's hard work
2013-11-21 22:02:15	Espyo	the fact was too obvious
2013-11-21 22:02:27	Espyo	Smash is even bigger than Pikmin
2013-11-21 22:02:58	Espyo	hmm, in terms of fanbase size
2013-11-21 22:03:14	Espyo	that fact might've been fun to know when Brawl was being developed, but not after
2013-11-21 22:03:27	Espyo	so now I took the opportunity to remove it and add a similar fact for Smash 4
2013-11-21 22:03:59	Espyo	as for the infobox game things, I prettied up all infoboxes
2013-11-21 22:04:06	Espyo	for infobox game, it was just the documentation and such
2013-11-21 22:04:12	@J	I mean, why did you remove the link?
2013-11-21 22:04:19	Espyo	it linked to Brawl
2013-11-21 22:04:22	Espyo	not Smash 4
2013-11-21 22:04:33	Espyo	but either way... why do we have default parameters that show the Pikmin boxart?
2013-11-21 22:04:43	@J	yeah, that was my question
2013-11-21 22:04:54	@J	oh
2013-11-21 22:04:54	@J	.......
2013-11-21 22:04:57	@J	I'm silly
2013-11-21 22:05:01	@J	I thought you _added_ those
2013-11-21 22:05:01	Espyo	a game that has no boxart (thinking of a minigame somewhere, like Nintendo World), shouldn't really show the Pikmin box
2013-11-21 22:05:03	@J	never mind, then
2013-11-21 22:05:05	Espyo	heh
2013-11-21 22:05:19	@J	and yeah, the Brawl thing, I didn't realise you changed it to mean Smash 4
2013-11-21 22:05:25	Espyo	hehe
2013-11-21 22:05:25	@J	I was thinking Brawl was still the latest game
2013-11-21 22:05:30	Espyo	nope
2013-11-21 22:05:31	@J	is 4 even out yet?
2013-11-21 22:05:33	Espyo	but don't worry
2013-11-21 22:05:42	Espyo	a LOT of people call it Super Smash Bros. Brawl 4
2013-11-21 22:05:53	Espyo	and sometimes they call it just Brawl when referring to the latest
2013-11-21 22:06:00	Espyo	being developed still; a new character might be unveiled tomorrow
2013-11-21 22:06:14	Espyo	tomorrow's the release of the newest Mario game and Zelda game
2013-11-21 22:06:39	Espyo	all main Mario games are already revealed, and as for Zelda, neither Zelda or Ganondorf show up in that game, I don't think, so everyone's wondering who's going to be unveiled
2013-11-21 22:06:59	Espyo	anyway, on a more Pikmin-related note, Olimar's moveset thus far looks like the same as in Braw
2013-11-21 22:07:00	Espyo	*l
2013-11-21 22:07:15	@J	weird to call it the newest instalment when it's not out yet, then
2013-11-21 22:07:34	Espyo	hmm
2013-11-21 22:07:42	Espyo	I guess, but at the same time, it's kinda not
2013-11-21 22:08:08	@J	also, I never knew instalment was spelled 'installment' in US English
2013-11-21 22:08:29	@J	[21:58:53] Espyo because it's clearly some dolt trying to self-glorify himself by having a wiki all
2013-11-21 22:08:29	@J	to himself, out of other people's hard work
2013-11-21 22:08:30	Espyo	installment <— Firefox' not underlining this
2013-11-21 22:08:33	@J	yes, but how does it harm us?
2013-11-21 22:08:38	@J	if it doesn't, I see no problem
2013-11-21 22:08:46	Espyo	it's not direct competition, but come on
2013-11-21 22:08:49	Espyo	it's someone being a prick
2013-11-21 22:08:53	Espyo	I can't live with that
2013-11-21 22:10:55	@J	or it's someone having fun
2013-11-21 22:11:43	Espyo	I really don't think...
2013-11-21 22:13:38	@J	and you're just going to go spoiling the guy's fun
2013-11-21 22:13:46	@J	clearly the E in Espyo stands for evil
2013-11-21 22:13:58	@J	or maybe Espyo _is_ the Portuguese word for evil
2013-11-21 22:14:17	Espyo	it is, but that's besides the point
2013-11-21 22:16:21	@J	anyway, you're just seeing the worst in people
2013-11-21 22:16:42	@J	it's clearly some kid who wants attention
2013-11-21 22:16:47	Espyo	of course
2013-11-21 22:16:54	Espyo	but even PikFan and the rest agree he's lying about spamming and such
2013-11-21 22:17:04	@J	trying to shut it down...just seems kind of unnecessary
2013-11-21 22:17:17	@J	meh, I don't know anything about that
2013-11-21 22:18:19	@J	oh, kind of related - not sure if we talked about this before, but at some point I found a discussion on the Wikia Pikmin wiki about how Pikipedia was an illegal copy
2013-11-21 22:18:31	Espyo	pfft
2013-11-21 22:18:36	Espyo	suuuure it is

2013-11-21 22:43:33	Espyo	hey
2013-11-21 22:43:37	Prezintenden	yo
2013-11-21 22:43:57	Prezintenden	so i gave up on IT, i have time now to make some articles and shit
2013-11-21 22:45:51	Prezintenden	what's the easiest way to get screenshots from the wiiu?
2013-11-21 22:52:24	Espyo	good
2013-11-21 22:52:34	Espyo	and you're wise, I've regret every day of my college course
2013-11-21 22:52:39	Espyo	hmm, I'd say a capture card
2013-11-21 22:52:46	Espyo	apparently it's not that different from recording Wii footage
2013-11-21 22:52:54	Espyo	which is not that different from recording GC footage
2013-11-21 22:54:35	Prezintenden	nothing possible through wii-internet or something?
2013-11-21 22:55:35	Espyo	nope
2013-11-21 22:55:52	Prezintenden	i wouldn't call myself avaricious but 80€ JUST for uploading pikmin...
2013-11-21 22:55:52	Testyo	80 € = £ 68.416  / $ 108.512 
2013-11-21 22:55:59	Prezintenden	thank you testyo
2013-11-21 22:56:18	Espyo	woah, what?
2013-11-21 22:56:20	Espyo	 80€?
2013-11-21 22:56:20	Testyo	80 € = £ 68.416  / $ 108.512 
2013-11-21 22:56:23	Espyo	I got mine for 30€
2013-11-21 22:56:23	Testyo	30 € = £ 25.656  / $ 40.692 
2013-11-21 22:56:33	Prezintenden	1080p?
2013-11-21 22:56:39	Espyo	and this is /Portugal/, everything is growing more expensive
2013-11-21 22:56:44	Espyo	well, 720x576, IIRC
2013-11-21 22:56:59	Prezintenden	mmmmm well i guess we could live with that
2013-11-21 22:57:04	Espyo	decent enough quality, and 720x576 woks fine for wiki screenshots
2013-11-21 22:57:09	Espyo	I made quite a few videos with it, haven't regret it yet
2013-11-21 22:57:16	Prezintenden	what's it called?
2013-11-21 22:57:19	Prezintenden	or the company
2013-11-21 22:57:25	Espyo	...it doesn't really have a name
2013-11-21 22:57:35	Espyo	but at the same time, it's not like an unbranded kind
2013-11-21 22:57:46	Espyo	I'll try my best to Google it based on what I know, hang on
2013-11-21 22:58:01	Prezintenden	i can only find 70+ on amazon
2013-11-21 22:58:08	Prezintenden	not sure what to look for
2013-11-21 22:59:16	Espyo	http://i01.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v0/513042375/2011-New-Arrival-USB-2-0-Video-Audio-Grabber-AV-VCR-DVD-Capture-Card-Adapter-Support.jpg
2013-11-21 22:59:21	Espyo	it's this, except with a different palette
2013-11-21 22:59:29	Espyo	it says exactly that, "Video&Audio Grabber"
2013-11-21 23:00:13	Prezintenden	"video grabber" seems to be the "official" name
2013-11-21 23:01:27	Espyo	ah
2013-11-21 23:01:32	Espyo	see if you can find something with that name then
2013-11-21 23:01:36	Espyo	I actually bought mine on a store
2013-11-21 23:01:52	Espyo	also, I bought some splitter cables, they allow you to have the gameplay on the TV and on the computer screen
2013-11-21 23:02:02	Espyo	for screenshots, you probably don't need this, but to record gameplay video, you might
2013-11-21 23:02:16	Espyo	seeing as there's a slight delay when watching the action happen on the computer screen
2013-11-21 23:09:40	@J	I always used a DVD recorder, though obviously that's limited to standard resolution
2013-11-21 23:10:16	@J	not sure what outputs the Wii U has, though I guess only HDMI can do higher resolution, for which you'd probably need a better capture card
2013-11-21 23:10:43	@J	anyway, DVD recorder stuff looks better than capture card for non-HD, in my experience
2013-11-21 23:10:45	@J	also hi
2013-11-21 23:14:37	Prezintenden	looks like I'm going to have a lot of fun with my win7 64 bit with the cheap software
2013-11-21 23:15:59	Espyo	I'm using w7 64-bit as well, and everything's always fine
2013-11-21 23:16:04	Espyo	also I was VirtualDub, which is free
2013-11-21 23:16:47	Prezintenden	okay so the wiiu has an AV out but not av cable help
2013-11-21 23:17:41	Prezintenden	they want me to use the wii cable
2013-11-21 23:17:42	Prezintenden	...
2013-11-21 23:19:05	Prezintenden	okay they sell them online
2013-11-21 23:19:33	Prezintenden	"480P HD Component"

2013-11-21 23:21:52	@J	it doesn't exist in Europ

2013-11-21 23:36:10	Prezintenden	looks legit
2013-11-21 23:36:18	Prezintenden	2€ from hong kong
2013-11-21 23:36:18	Testyo	2 € = £ 1.7104  / $ 2.7128 
2013-11-21 23:36:43	Prezintenden	plus 0,19 shipping
2013-11-21 23:37:45	Prezintenden	I'm tempted to try, it's just 2 bucks
2013-11-21 23:39:35	Espyo	those are just cables
2013-11-21 23:39:50	Espyo	the splitters
2013-11-21 23:39:56	Espyo	but yeah, for 2€, I'd say go for it
2013-11-21 23:39:56	Testyo	2 € = £ 1.7104  / $ 2.7128 
2013-11-21 23:40:02	Espyo	mine cost 5€ each, and I bought 3
2013-11-21 23:40:02	Testyo	5 € = £ 4.276  / $ 6.782 
2013-11-21 23:40:07	Espyo	so it was actually 30 + 15
2013-11-21 23:40:28	Prezintenden	?
2013-11-21 23:40:38	Prezintenden	so you don't think they split
2013-11-21 23:41:12	Prezintenden	http://imgs.inkfrog.com/pix/tattoocountry/23985-2.jpg
2013-11-21 23:41:35	Prezintenden	looks like in the head they split the signal in 2. pretty sure it's not that simple
2013-11-21 23:41:40	Prezintenden	but lol
2013-11-21 23:41:47	Prezintenden	it's too stupid not to work
2013-11-21 23:42:10	Prezintenden	hell
2013-11-21 23:42:12	Prezintenden	makes me laugh
2013-11-21 23:42:49	@J	wait, how does that work?
2013-11-21 23:42:51	Prezintenden	i genuinely don't understand how the s-video split works
2013-11-21 23:43:03	@J	don't those sorts of cables normally have sticky-out bits?
2013-11-21 23:43:16	@J	otherwise you need some sort of adapter to connect them to TV/things
2013-11-21 23:43:39	Prezintenden	...sticky out? you mean male ends?
2013-11-21 23:44:34	@J	yeah
2013-11-21 23:45:00	Espyo	I didn't say they didn't split
2013-11-21 23:45:04	Espyo	in fact, I said they were the splitters
2013-11-21 23:45:13	Espyo	it's simple, but it's kinda bizarre
2013-11-21 23:45:17	Espyo	because it's backwards
2013-11-21 23:45:25	Espyo	it's like... hard to explain
2013-11-21 23:45:36	Espyo	looks like you grab what's being fed into the TV and dupe it into the computer
2013-11-21 23:45:42	Espyo	instead of... splitting the Wii U's signal
2013-11-21 23:45:54	Espyo	well, I can help you set that up when you get it, I'll take a look at how mine are
2013-11-21 23:46:30	@J	[23:45:36] Espyo looks like you grab what's being fed into the TV and dupe it into the computer
2013-11-21 23:46:30	@J	[23:45:42] Espyo instead of... splitting the Wii U's signal
2013-11-21 23:46:34	@J	I don't get the difference
2013-11-21 23:46:38	Prezintenden	at the moment I'm just trying to figure out what I'm about to buy
2013-11-21 23:47:17	Prezintenden	i can sort of imagine a difference but it's probably not what he mean
2013-11-21 23:47:18	Espyo	it's not TV <— Wii U —> computer
2013-11-21 23:47:18	Prezintenden	t
2013-11-21 23:47:34	Espyo	it looks more like it's Wii U —> TV —> computer
2013-11-21 23:47:50	@J	hmm
2013-11-21 23:48:05	Prezintenden	so which is which now
2013-11-21 23:48:17	Prezintenden	first one is s video cable right
2013-11-21 23:48:28	Espyo	everything is S-video everywhere
2013-11-21 23:48:32	Espyo	err...
2013-11-21 23:48:34	Espyo	wait
2013-11-21 23:48:39	Espyo	it's really confusing, but also simple
2013-11-21 23:48:47	Espyo	let me just unlock this phone and I'll get to it

2013-11-21 23:49:50	@J	SCART is higher quality, switch to coaxial to avoid lag
2013-11-21 23:49:56	@J	though of course that involves tuning it in

2013-11-22 20:51:03	@J	you told me that before?
2013-11-22 21:15:45	Espyo	what, what I said before AND after disconnecting?
2013-11-22 21:15:57	Espyo	I couldn't be sure that what I said before disconnecting went through
2013-11-22 21:15:59	Espyo	because windows is insane
2013-11-22 21:20:49	@J	oh, that's why you said 'again'
2013-11-22 21:21:04	@J	I thought you were referring to another day
2013-11-22 21:21:15	Espyo	ah
2013-11-22 21:22:00	@J	speaking of Windows, the not receiving the first mouse event on an unfocused window is fun
2013-11-22 21:23:25	Espyo	what
2013-11-22 21:23:30	Espyo	oh yeah
2013-11-22 21:23:56	Espyo	wait, it does receive it
2013-11-22 21:24:02	Espyo	and the unfocused window does parse it
2013-11-22 21:24:05	Espyo	(and get into focus)
2013-11-22 21:25:40	@J	yeah, it gets into focus, but doesn't do anything else with it
2013-11-22 21:25:56	@J	like if you click a button on an unfocused window, you have to click twice
2013-11-22 21:26:41	Espyo	I just tried, it's not the case
2013-11-22 21:26:54	Espyo	although I remember that happening several times before
2013-11-22 21:27:14	@J	hmm, maybe it depends on the window
2013-11-22 21:27:19	@J	try some other programs
2013-11-22 21:27:24	@J	like the file explorer thing
2013-11-22 21:28:45	Espyo	nope, it worked fine...
2013-11-22 21:30:11	@J	hmm, weird
2013-11-22 22:01:42	@J	okay, why did Firefox change the 'inspect' keyboard shortcut for their developer tools to be the same as Firebug's?
2013-11-22 22:02:44	Espyo	wow that sucs
2013-11-22 22:02:46	Espyo	*sucks
2013-11-22 22:02:50	Espyo	it used to be U, right?
2013-11-22 22:05:24	@J	ctrl-shift-c
2013-11-22 22:05:27	@J	wait
2013-11-22 22:05:28	@J	oh
2013-11-22 22:05:33	@J	I don't know
2013-11-22 22:05:39	@J	it's c now
2013-11-22 22:06:25	Espyo	oh
2013-11-22 22:06:39	Espyo	I was thinking of the accelerator key on the context menu
2013-11-22 22:06:43	Espyo	wait, ctrl+shift+c?
2013-11-22 22:06:50	Espyo	that's so... not a debugger shortcut
2013-11-22 22:06:55	Espyo	Firebug is F12, IIRC

2013-11-22 23:24:18	Los_Plagas	Though I wouldn't think someone would luck up Ujadani

2013-11-22 23:30:08	Espyo	I think that's some conspiracy theory
2013-11-22 23:30:21	Espyo	about the Whiskerpillars being Ujadani
2013-11-22 23:30:27	Espyo	which is nuts and not stated anywhere
2013-11-22 23:30:46	Los_Plagas	It was on an old talk page, but if it is a conspiracy, it's currently inactive.
2013-11-22 23:30:55	Espyo	unless it's on like the e-cards, or Prima guide
2013-11-22 23:30:58	Espyo	but if not, delete

2013-11-22 23:31:08	Los_Plagas	And yes, delete.
2013-11-22 23:31:20	Los_Plagas	But we really should add another, more realistic redirect
2013-11-22 23:31:34	Los_Plagas	Because who /is/ going to look up Ujadani?
2013-11-22 23:31:39	Los_Plagas	Is "insects" too broad a term?
2013-11-22 23:32:05	Espyo	we already have WW bugs and such
2013-11-22 23:32:11	Espyo	and nobody really looks them up
2013-11-22 23:32:18	Espyo	if they know about them, they know how to look
2013-11-22 23:32:27	Espyo	also it's as easy as going to [[Wistful Wild]]
2013-11-22 23:33:28	Los_Plagas	That's true.
2013-11-22 23:33:39	Los_Plagas	Most players who do know would most likely take them for granted.
2013-11-22 23:34:50	Espyo	yeah
2013-11-22 23:36:13	Los_Plagas	Also, this is off-topic, weird, and kind of stalkerish, but I think I've figured out PikFan's name! . . .yeah, definitely stalkerish but whatever.
2013-11-22 23:37:14	Los_Plagas	Again, please forgive me for sounding like a stalker.
2013-11-22 23:37:23	Los_Plagas	It's just weird, so I felt like mentioning it.

2013-11-22 23:44:14	@J	I don't think I did
2013-11-22 23:44:22	@J	it was just on my GitHub account, right?
2013-11-22 23:44:26	Espyo	you did, but I mostly know because gmail sent — yeah, that
2013-11-22 23:44:34	@J	wait, GMail?
2013-11-22 23:44:34	Los_Plagas	Of course, there /is/ a box where you can enter your name upon signing up for Pikipedia

2013-11-22 23:45:25	@J	but no
2013-11-22 23:45:32	Espyo	ah yeah, GitHub
2013-11-22 23:45:40	Espyo	when someone does something on my issues, I get an e-mail
2013-11-22 23:45:43	Espyo	and that's there
2013-11-22 23:46:26	Los_Plagas	John? Joe? Joseph? Jake? 
2013-11-22 23:46:35	@J	2 of those
2013-11-22 23:46:50	Espyo	Jekel
2013-11-22 23:46:59	@J	what is that
2013-11-22 23:47:08	Espyo	I'm not sure if that's right, but
2013-11-22 23:47:11	Espyo	Dr. Jekel and Mr. Hyde
2013-11-22 23:47:19	@J	Jekyll, maybe?
2013-11-22 23:47:27	@J	yes
2013-11-22 23:47:32	Espyo	ah, yeah
2013-11-22 23:48:34	@J	so, I've been learning how to juggle recently, at lunchtimes
2013-11-22 23:48:39	Los_Plagas	John & Joe? Joe & Joseph? Joseph & John? Joe & Jake? Jake & Joseph? John and Joseph? John & Jake? 
2013-11-22 23:48:56	@J	weird thing is, it makes my _legs_ ache
2013-11-22 23:49:16	@J	then I realised that just shows I'm really bad, because it means I'm bending down to pick up the balls a lot
2013-11-22 23:49:30	@J	Los_Plagas: Joe is short for Joseph, right?  So those
2013-11-22 23:49:52	Los_Plagas	Heh heh
2013-11-22 23:50:13	Los_Plagas	I actually believe PikFan's name is Joe, or Jo (though that's more feminine), or something of the sort.
2013-11-22 23:50:23	@J	hmm
2013-11-22 23:52:52	Espyo	what if you're sitting down?
2013-11-22 23:53:06	Los_Plagas	Because his email is "JoJoRose," so, yeah. That sounds like a corruption as a name, which is common in emails.
2013-11-22 23:53:08	Espyo	Joe... I never actually thought about what it was a short for
2013-11-22 23:54:06	@J	sitting down, what?
2013-11-22 23:54:25	Los_Plagas	And sitting down might make it even harder depending on the height of the places where you're sitting, because then you might have to stretch your back more.
2013-11-22 23:55:05	Espyo	while juggling
2013-11-22 23:55:12	Espyo	hmm, yeah
2013-11-22 23:55:17	Espyo	but it's really weird
2013-11-22 23:55:23	Espyo	maybe you lean too much?
2013-11-22 23:55:47	@J	wait, you're trying to explain the aching legs?
2013-11-22 23:56:21	Los_Plagas	It could also be that. I've noticed people tend to bend their spine more during strenuous activity, or something that requires preciseness.
2013-11-22 23:56:31	Los_Plagas	Take jump-roping, which has both
2013-11-22 23:56:56	Los_Plagas	Whenever I try to do it, I always lean my back forward with every jump until I finally have to stop before I fall on my face.
2013-11-22 23:57:32	Espyo	yeah
2013-11-22 23:59:57	@J	I told you it's got to be because I'm bending down a lot, though
2013-11-23 00:00:43	Los_Plagas	Let's not be /too/ pessimistic. 
2013-11-23 00:00:57	Los_Plagas	You can't be /that/ bad (unlike me . . .)
2013-11-23 00:02:57	@J	mm
2013-11-23 00:03:18	@J	well, it gets kind of boring if you can do a type of juggling fairly consistently
2013-11-23 00:03:29	@J	so you try something different
2013-11-23 00:03:35	@J	so it's always hard, and you always fail
2013-11-23 00:03:48	@J	anyway, I should go
2013-11-23 00:04:02	@J	I'm actually planning to do things tomorrow
2013-11-23 00:04:08	@J	no procrastination for me

2013-11-23 00:25:16	Espyo	kinda lazing it
2013-11-23 00:25:23	Espyo	also this isn't my laptop, and the wikia session keeps dropping

2013-11-23 17:30:59	@PikFan	...an admin knows more than me
2013-11-23 17:31:03	@PikFan	irony
2013-11-23 17:32:33	@PikFan	in a reply to a bunch of users about the copied wiki situation, I wrote this: "It's just vile, even worse than Wikia's usual trash, and just poisons the name of Pikipedia."
2013-11-23 17:36:31	Prezintenden	oh right i opened this window
2013-11-23 17:36:56	Prezintenden	yeah i bought a sitck thingy for 10 but no splitter yet i can't find any
2013-11-23 17:37:45	Espyo	pretty nice
2013-11-23 17:37:51	Espyo	you can still test if it works correctly though
2013-11-23 17:38:05	Espyo	you only really need the splitters to be able to see the gameplay on your TV AND computer
2013-11-23 17:38:33	Espyo	PikFan: got something important I need you to test
2013-11-23 17:38:43	@PikFan	?
2013-11-23 17:39:41	Espyo	what day are you at, in Pikmin 2?
2013-11-23 17:39:59	@PikFan	which Pikmin 2, GCN or NPC! ?
2013-11-23 17:40:07	Espyo	the furthest one
2013-11-23 17:40:11	@PikFan	oh
2013-11-23 17:40:15	Espyo	and I thought you only had NPC!, not both
2013-11-23 17:40:30	@PikFan	hm
2013-11-23 17:40:33	@PikFan	let me check
2013-11-23 17:40:39	@PikFan	somewhere around day 566
2013-11-23 17:40:55	Espyo	and are you getting Ujadani still?
2013-11-23 17:41:58	@PikFan	yes
2013-11-23 17:42:05	@PikFan	on day 567
2013-11-23 17:42:22	Espyo	http://pikmin.wikia.com/wiki/Ujadani
2013-11-23 17:42:33	Espyo	so "starting at Day 31 and ends at day 301" is incorrect?
2013-11-23 17:42:42	@PikFan	yeah
2013-11-23 17:42:45	Espyo	...
2013-11-23 17:42:55	@PikFan	whoever wrote that plain hasn't played the game long enough
2013-11-23 17:43:02	Espyo	what version are you at day ~566 at? NPC!?
2013-11-23 17:43:13	@PikFan	no, in GCN
2013-11-23 17:43:20	Espyo	hmm
2013-11-23 17:43:21	@PikFan	day 567 is on GCN
2013-11-23 17:43:26	Espyo	maybe that limit is NPC!-only
2013-11-23 17:43:34	Espyo	because I read elsewhere that they disappear after day 300 as well
2013-11-23 17:43:44	@PikFan	hm
2013-11-23 17:43:45	Prezintenden	pretty sure that was written way before npc was released
2013-11-23 17:43:48	Miles	I've read about that long before NPC was released
2013-11-23 17:43:54	Espyo	either wikia copied the fake fact from that place, it was the other way around, or it's actually true, but for GCN only
2013-11-23 17:44:13	Espyo	in that case, it can't have anything to do with the Wii version
2013-11-23 17:44:15	Miles	Considering some people thought that your file was deleted on Day 300
2013-11-23 17:44:16	@PikFan	well I've gotten ujadani after day 300 so that's a lie
2013-11-23 17:44:16	Miles	Um, yeah
2013-11-23 17:44:21	Espyo	pfffthah, what?
2013-11-23 17:44:29	Prezintenden	the good ol gamefaqs days
2013-11-23 17:44:30	Espyo	why would it be deleted after day 30?
2013-11-23 17:44:31	@PikFan	.../what/
2013-11-23 17:44:39	Miles	People are idiots
2013-11-23 17:44:45	Espyo	true
2013-11-23 17:44:51	Espyo	*day 300
2013-11-23 17:45:06	Espyo	time to point this out on the wiki
2013-11-23 17:45:22	@PikFan	another correction in wikia's fallacies
2013-11-23 17:45:51	Espyo	this just further strengthens my theory that someone on Pikmin wikia is sabotaging them
2013-11-23 17:45:59	@PikFan	yeah, so since I'm on day 567, the day of the ujadani is only 4 days away

2013-11-23 17:48:23	ThePikminMeister	Hi pikfan
2013-11-23 17:48:26	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Ujadani&diff=77173&oldid=75984 feels good to stab wikia
2013-11-23 17:48:31	@PikFan	hi ThePikminMeister
2013-11-23 17:48:49	ThePikminMeister	I'm guessing you are back from hiatus
2013-11-23 17:49:05	@PikFan	yeah
2013-11-23 17:49:10	ThePikminMeister	Ok
2013-11-23 17:49:17	@PikFan	Espyo: ...I can see some bias in there
2013-11-23 17:49:24	Espyo	:(
2013-11-23 17:49:27	Espyo	it's not aimed at wikia though
2013-11-23 17:49:29	@PikFan	er, not bias
2013-11-23 17:49:36	Espyo	again, I've seen that come from other places as well
2013-11-23 17:49:45	@PikFan	"This myth must've stemmed from the rumors that were discussed after the game was released"
2013-11-23 17:49:46	ThePikminMeister	So, what did you mean by "attribute the work to us"?
2013-11-23 17:49:54	@PikFan	seems a bit out of place if you ask me
2013-11-23 17:49:55	Espyo	that = "Ujadani disappear after day 300"
2013-11-23 17:50:06	Espyo	like, the wording is awkward?
2013-11-23 17:50:20	Miles	Like I don't think that's worth mentioning at all
2013-11-23 17:50:29	@PikFan	ThePikminMeister: I meant that you just need to credit Pikipedia and Pikmin Fanon for the work
2013-11-23 17:50:35	ThePikminMeister	Oh ok
2013-11-23 17:51:05	Espyo	it points out that we know about the 300-day thing, and we know it's a fake
2013-11-23 17:51:15	Espyo	people go to wikia, see that they disappear after day 300
2013-11-23 17:51:19	Espyo	then they go to us, don't see that
2013-11-23 17:51:25	Espyo	and assume we're missing info
2013-11-23 17:51:26	ThePikminMeister	Well I sent Donopik a message on pikminopedia so I'll see what he wants me to do
2013-11-23 17:51:33	@PikFan	okay
2013-11-23 17:51:45	@PikFan	Espyo: I see
2013-11-23 17:53:19	Espyo	I have to admit: taking a jab at Pikmin wikia with that edit was satisfying
2013-11-23 17:53:29	@PikFan	hehe
2013-11-23 17:53:32	Espyo	but I did it mostly to let the information be known that that's a wrong rumor
2013-11-23 17:53:54	Espyo	instead of making it like we know nothing about anything, and the others do (regardless of being right or not)
2013-11-23 17:57:52	@PikFan	also I have a question that might take a very /very/ long time to answer
2013-11-23 17:57:56	@J	[17:51:15] Espyo people go to wikia, see that they disappear after day 300
2013-11-23 17:57:56	@J	[17:51:19] Espyo then they go to us, don't see that
2013-11-23 17:57:56	@J	[17:51:25] Espyo and assume we're missing info
2013-11-23 17:58:01	@J	...no-one's going to do that
2013-11-23 17:58:06	@PikFan	what happens when you get to day 1000?
2013-11-23 17:58:17	Espyo	how are they not?
2013-11-23 17:58:22	Espyo	we do that all the time, the other way around
2013-11-23 17:58:37	Espyo	and maybe not specifically scout every single bit of every single page and compare them
2013-11-23 17:58:45	Espyo	but be a common wikia-goer, notice that "fact"
2013-11-23 17:59:04	Espyo	and then a few days later, learn about Pikipedia, and decide to check out what's up with us
2013-11-23 17:59:51	Espyo	that edit could be the difference between us being the "lone rangers who think they're cool making their own thing, when they can't even keep up-to-date with all the facts and tidbits", or "those guys that actually care about the content and information"
2013-11-23 18:00:21	Espyo	the day number should be displayed normally on the bubble
2013-11-23 18:00:34	Espyo	Pikmin and Pikmin 2 squash numbers on the HUD
2013-11-23 18:01:02	Espyo	as per Miles' Pikmin count underflow video with the Blues, the number is barely readable if it's 6+ digits long, but it's all there
2013-11-23 18:01:18	@PikFan	so "1000" will be shown, but squished?
2013-11-23 18:01:19	ThePikminMeister	So much text
2013-11-23 18:01:27	Espyo	yep
2013-11-23 18:01:29	ThePikminMeister	All I see is blue text
2013-11-23 18:01:36	@PikFan	that'd be Espyo
2013-11-23 18:01:41	ThePikminMeister	I know
2013-11-23 18:02:16	@PikFan	Espyo, stop drowning ThePikminMeister with your blue text that's like an ocean
2013-11-23 18:02:23	@PikFan	just kidding
2013-11-23 18:02:23	ThePikminMeister	Lol
2013-11-23 18:02:34	Espyo	gotta type fast
2013-11-23 18:02:51	ThePikminMeister	I'm getting messages from Donopik so brb
2013-11-23 18:03:24	@PikFan	okay
2013-11-23 18:07:41	ThePikminMeister	I'm back
2013-11-23 18:07:54	@PikFan	welcome back
2013-11-23 18:08:25	ThePikminMeister	Donopik said that he wants to block you from the wiki, for some reason.
2013-11-23 18:08:35	@PikFan	which wiki?
2013-11-23 18:08:41	ThePikminMeister	Pikminopedia
2013-11-23 18:08:41	@PikFan	the wikia?
2013-11-23 18:08:55	@PikFan	why would he block me, all I did was leave a comment
2013-11-23 18:09:03	ThePikminMeister	That's what I told him
2013-11-23 18:09:11	ThePikminMeister	He said it was "offensive"
2013-11-23 18:09:30	@PikFan	can you bring DonoPik on here, please?
2013-11-23 18:09:52	ThePikminMeister	He told me he isn't able to use the chatroom here
2013-11-23 18:10:01	@PikFan	oh
2013-11-23 18:10:01	ThePikminMeister	But the chatroom at pikminopedia is available
2013-11-23 18:10:12	@PikFan	eeh...
2013-11-23 18:10:39	@PikFan	wait, how can he be using Pikminopedia's chatroom but not ours?
2013-11-23 18:10:47	ThePikminMeister	I...
2013-11-23 18:10:50	ThePikminMeister	I don't know
2013-11-23 18:11:09	Prezintenden	seems sketchy
2013-11-23 18:11:12	Prezintenden	might be a trap
2013-11-23 18:11:37	ThePikminMeister	Maybe
2013-11-23 18:11:45	ThePikminMeister	Ill find out
2013-11-23 18:11:48	@PikFan	It's a trap!
2013-11-23 18:13:09	ThePikminMeister	I asked him to go to the pikminopedia chatroom
2013-11-23 18:13:17	ThePikminMeister	I'll ask him some questions
2013-11-23 18:15:18	Espyo	btw, seeing as we're gathered here now
2013-11-23 18:15:30	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/User:Espyo/max_kills I've been completing this yesterday
2013-11-23 18:15:35	Espyo	now I have to do the Pikmin 2 things
2013-11-23 18:15:43	Espyo	is there still any doubt about what this project is all about?
2013-11-23 18:15:54	@PikFan	no
2013-11-23 18:15:55	ThePikminMeister	Ocean time
2013-11-23 18:15:55	Espyo	not sure if everybody already understands what this study is for or not
2013-11-23 18:16:09	Espyo	mostly Prez and GP, IIRC
2013-11-23 18:16:18	@PikFan	it's to record how much Pikmin an enemy can kill at one time, right?
2013-11-23 18:16:34	@PikFan	*how much Pikmin maximum
2013-11-23 18:16:35	Espyo	for each attack, yeah
2013-11-23 18:16:44	Espyo	I've discovered some interesting things
2013-11-23 18:16:57	Espyo	for instance, what's the difference between Red Bulborbs and Spotty Bulbears?
2013-11-23 18:17:01	ThePikminMeister	Ranging Bloysters
2013-11-23 18:17:05	ThePikminMeister	They are weird
2013-11-23 18:17:11	Espyo	besides how they look, and how the formers' spots blinks
2013-11-23 18:17:23	Espyo	yeah they are
2013-11-23 18:17:43	ThePikminMeister	I wonder what miyamoto was thinking when he implemented that
2013-11-23 18:17:46	@PikFan	thinking about going outside now
2013-11-23 18:17:48	Espyo	*the latter's spots blink
2013-11-23 18:17:48	ThePikminMeister	Why am I pink?
2013-11-23 18:17:49	@PikFan	bye
2013-11-23 18:17:53	ThePikminMeister	Bye pikfan
2013-11-23 18:17:54	Espyo	bye

2013-11-23 18:19:11	Prezintenden	yeah i get what it's listing. was that your question?
2013-11-23 18:20:44	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Template_talk:Infobox_enemy here, you point out that this listing is inaccurate and pointless
2013-11-23 18:20:57	ThePikminMeister	Well anyway I'm gonna go, bye

2013-11-23 18:21:47	Prezintenden	oh dear, espyo confronting me with the sins of my youth
2013-11-23 18:22:09	Espyo	hehe
2013-11-23 18:22:11	Espyo	that's why I was asking
2013-11-23 18:22:17	Espyo	to make sure that everything's clearer now
2013-11-23 18:23:57	Prezintenden	funny, i do think it would be interesting to know.  putting it in the infobox seems a bit much though
2013-11-23 18:24:28	Espyo	hmm
2013-11-23 18:24:32	Espyo	any other suggestion?
2013-11-23 18:24:40	Espyo	maybe a section on the articles for extra info
2013-11-23 18:24:43	Espyo	because there's more info per enemy
2013-11-23 18:24:49	Prezintenden	on where to put it? no, infobox seems the best place
2013-11-23 18:24:54	Espyo	like if they go back to their original spot after traveling a certain distance
2013-11-23 18:25:31	Prezintenden	something like a "specs" section? hm
2013-11-23 18:25:45	-->	ThePikminMeister (Mibbit@sig-584go79l.dyn.optonline.net) has joined #pikipedia
2013-11-23 18:25:56	<--	ThePikminMeister (Mibbit@sig-584go79l.dyn.optonline.net) has quit (Client Quit)

2013-11-23 18:26:29	Espyo	the problem is that stuff like the distance they can travel until they go back isn't specific
2013-11-23 18:26:36	Espyo	we can add whether or not they /do/ go back
2013-11-23 18:26:41	Espyo	but not exact distances, I don't think
2013-11-23 18:26:56	<--	Donopik (Mibbit@sig-584go79l.dyn.optonline.net) has quit (Client Quit)
2013-11-23 18:27:06	Espyo	uh...
2013-11-23 18:27:44	Espyo	anyway, maybe add the info on the body of the article, and specify the number after describing the corresponding attack
2013-11-23 18:28:18	Prezintenden	yeah that sounds good
2013-11-23 18:29:02	Prezintenden	hm, you don't think the chase-distance is fixed for all creatures?
2013-11-23 18:29:11	Espyo	it might be, yeah
2013-11-23 18:29:17	Espyo	no problem in that case
2013-11-23 18:29:41	Espyo	though I would like to make it look like we have a full study on the kill cap for every attack in the games, and not just a random number pointed out in an article
2013-11-23 18:30:13	Espyo	putting it in the infobox makes it look like something all enemy articles have, but on the body, it looks like only some articles have that info, and it looks like we didn't research all attacks of all enemies
2013-11-23 18:30:32	Espyo	also, should an attack have a different cap between Pikmin 1 and 2, the infobox would have to get cluttered
2013-11-23 18:30:43	Espyo	but I might go with the body of the article, in the end
2013-11-23 18:33:14	Espyo	oh, regarding what I was saying before
2013-11-23 18:33:19	Espyo	Bulbears have more HP
2013-11-23 18:33:30	Miles	[13:29:05] <Prezintenden> hm, you don't think the chase-distance is fixed for all creatures?
2013-11-23 18:33:31	Espyo	but it turns out they can also eat 5 Pikmin in one gulp
2013-11-23 18:33:36	Miles	Enemy's have a "range" in the data
2013-11-23 18:33:39	Miles	...
2013-11-23 18:33:41	Miles	Enemies
2013-11-23 18:33:43	Miles	Not Enemy's
2013-11-23 18:33:45	Espyo	whereas Bulborbs eat 3
2013-11-23 18:33:47	Espyo	ah, great
2013-11-23 18:33:59	Espyo	I wasn't ready to say for sure a "yes" or a "no" regarding how hard it is to know the distance
2013-11-23 18:34:09	Espyo	because I can't check — don't have a Pikmin 2 ISO on this laptop
2013-11-23 18:34:15	Prezintenden	you mean chase range specifically? couldn't it also be the notice-pikmin-and-engage- range?
2013-11-23 18:34:26	Espyo	mightn't be
2013-11-23 18:34:39	Espyo	Dwarf Bulborbs don't even notice you if you're so close that your cursor is over them
2013-11-23 18:34:47	Espyo	but they do chase you for more than that distance
2013-11-23 18:34:59	Espyo	is the comment for those lines in the data files in Japanese?
2013-11-23 18:35:03	Prezintenden	which would speak for my case
2013-11-23 18:35:23	Espyo	I'm not following
2013-11-23 18:35:40	Espyo	the Dwarf Bulborbs' notice distance is just about the distance the cursor can get from a captain
2013-11-23 18:35:52	Espyo	but the chase distance, the distance until they give up and head back, is a lot longer
2013-11-23 18:36:16	Espyo	unless I'm missing something or misreading
2013-11-23 18:36:28	Espyo	(working out atm as well, kinda hard to focus for too long)
2013-11-23 18:36:35	Prezintenden	if d.bulborbs notice you at a smaller range than others but follow you the same range as others, it would stand to reason that "range" is defined as the notice distance and for every creautre individually, and chase is set constant for all somewhere
2013-11-23 18:37:30	Prezintenden	probably I'm spouting bullshit but I'm just saying just because there's a thingy called range it doesn't mean jack until we know what exactly it does
2013-11-23 18:37:31	Miles	...No it wouldn't
2013-11-23 18:37:35	Prezintenden	...
2013-11-23 18:37:51	Prezintenden	and why would that be
2013-11-23 18:37:56	Miles	It would mean that each enemy has two different values
2013-11-23 18:38:02	Miles	1 for noticing and 1 for chasing
2013-11-23 18:38:10	Espyo	yeah
2013-11-23 18:38:19	Espyo	that's the whole thing we were talking about, right?
2013-11-23 18:38:35	Prezintenden	yes. what speaks against that? as far as i understand, we only have one right now. regardless of which it it, we need a second
2013-11-23 18:38:45	Prezintenden	it is*
2013-11-23 18:38:52	Espyo	 18:34	Prezintenden	you mean chase range specifically? couldn't it also be the notice-pikmin-and-engage- range?
2013-11-23 18:39:04	Espyo	that "couldn't it also be" makes it sounds like you think they're the same value
2013-11-23 18:39:31	Prezintenden	oops. well i meant it could be either. no, i don't mean it's the same, definitely not
2013-11-23 18:40:04	Espyo	ah
2013-11-23 18:40:09	Espyo	misunderstanding then
2013-11-23 18:40:14	Prezintenden	you guys both thought i meant it like that? maybe it's my german syntax coming through,  i thought it was perfectly obvious what i meant...
2013-11-23 18:40:19	Espyo	hehe yeah
2013-11-23 18:40:32	Espyo	ok, as for the "chase until give up" distance being the same between all enemies that DO give up
2013-11-23 18:40:41	Espyo	well, Miles pointed out that that value is on the data files
2013-11-23 18:40:49	Espyo	so it mustn't be a hardcoded constant through all
2013-11-23 18:41:08	Espyo	actually, when researching the values yesterday for the kill caps
2013-11-23 18:41:10	Prezintenden	wait, so ARE we sure it is THAT?
2013-11-23 18:41:17	Espyo	I'm not sure
2013-11-23 18:41:30	Espyo	dunno if Miles knows if that's the "chase until give up" or "notice" range
2013-11-23 18:41:53	Espyo	I think while getting the values yesterday, I chased some Dwarfs and some mature Bulborbs
2013-11-23 18:42:05	Prezintenden	yeah, so that was my actual question, which remains unanswered
2013-11-23 18:42:05	Espyo	and I think the Dwarfs ran towards me for a smaller distance than mature ones
2013-11-23 18:42:08	Espyo	so it might be different
2013-11-23 18:42:11	Espyo	ah, I see
2013-11-23 18:42:15	Espyo	ok, it's all making sense now
2013-11-23 18:42:22	Espyo	the enemy files have a "range" value of sorts
2013-11-23 18:42:28	Prezintenden	the troubles of glaobalisation
2013-11-23 18:42:33	Prezintenden	*global, gah
2013-11-23 18:42:44	Espyo	is this the "chase until give up" or "notice" range? <- that's the question
2013-11-23 18:43:10	Espyo	looking back at your confusing sentence, it makes sense now
2013-11-23 18:43:14	Prezintenden	neutral enemies could help, maybe? honeywhisps would have n otice range, but no chace range
2013-11-23 18:43:15	Espyo	but without context, it didn't
2013-11-23 18:43:21	Prezintenden	*chase
2013-11-23 18:43:23	Espyo	hmm
2013-11-23 18:43:35	Espyo	if they use that range as a "notice" one, yeah
2013-11-23 18:43:40	Espyo	not really sure if I'd call it a "notice"
2013-11-23 18:43:45	Espyo	more like a "spawn distance"
2013-11-23 18:43:55	Espyo	it SHOULD be the "notice" range, yeah, don't see why not
2013-11-23 18:43:57	Prezintenden	mmmmmmmmm
2013-11-23 18:43:57	Espyo	but who knows
2013-11-23 18:44:05	Espyo	Pikmin files aren't exactly the cleanest things there is
2013-11-23 18:44:10	Espyo	worth a try, sure
2013-11-23 18:44:15	Prezintenden	yeah they might have a different programming there entirely
2013-11-23 18:44:22	Espyo	nothing I can do atm though, with the whole not having an ISO here thing
2013-11-23 18:44:25	Espyo	mhm
2013-11-23 18:44:44	Prezintenden	i could give you mine somehow
2013-11-23 18:44:58	Prezintenden	or if you're really crazy you can teach me how to access them
2013-11-23 18:45:19	Espyo	(one sec, working out)
2013-11-23 18:50:04	Prezintenden	hoohoooooo yeah that glitches page loads slow as ass
2013-11-23 18:50:38	Prezintenden	and i have amazing internet and a pretty high-end pc
2013-11-23 18:50:54	Espyo	I didn't notice it being too slow on my normal laptop
2013-11-23 18:50:57	Espyo	but on this one it's hell
2013-11-23 18:51:01	Espyo	J's taking care of it
2013-11-23 18:51:08	Espyo	anyway, do you have Dolphin?
2013-11-23 18:51:13	Prezintenden	it takes about 2 seconds until it stops stuttering when i scroll
2013-11-23 18:51:20	Prezintenden	that's waaaay long
2013-11-23 18:51:28	Prezintenden	yeah got it
2013-11-23 18:51:32	Espyo	it really is
2013-11-23 18:51:57	Espyo	ok, on the list of games on the main Dolphin window, right-click Pikmin 2, click properties
2013-11-23 18:52:01	Espyo	and then go on the filesystem tab
2013-11-23 18:52:05	Espyo	and...
2013-11-23 18:52:13	Espyo	well, this is the fun part: painstakingly search where the enemy files are
2013-11-23 18:52:28	Espyo	unless Miles knows where they are from the get-go, you kinda have to visit every folder
2013-11-23 18:52:34	Espyo	except obvious ones like the music folder
2013-11-23 18:52:41	Espyo	the enemy configs should be .ini files
2013-11-23 18:52:55	Prezintenden	okay sec i have the iso but not dolphin apparently...
2013-11-23 18:55:02	Espyo	should be easy to download
2013-11-23 18:55:11	Espyo	not that huge
2013-11-23 18:55:16	Prezintenden	yeah I'm done
2013-11-23 18:55:35	Espyo	https://dolphin-emu.org/ this is the official site, btw
2013-11-23 18:55:41	Espyo	don't download from the other jackass' site
2013-11-23 18:56:23	Prezintenden	...what the
2013-11-23 18:56:40	Prezintenden	it projects the game into a window that's outside of my screen
2013-11-23 18:56:47	Prezintenden	any idea how i can pull it over
2013-11-23 18:56:57	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Day#References also, the config file that controls the span of a day is in /user/Abe/time/time.ini, and the comments for the lines are in Japanese
2013-11-23 18:57:02	Espyo	so the enemy files should be something similar
2013-11-23 18:57:18	Espyo	right-click on the window on the taskbar, choose move
2013-11-23 18:57:23	Espyo	oh, or press the windows key and left
2013-11-23 18:57:26	Prezintenden	got it from the jackass site
2013-11-23 18:57:26	Miles	Well
2013-11-23 18:57:30	Espyo	to make it stick to the left side of the screen
2013-11-23 18:57:36	Espyo	...it shouldn't even allow you to run then
2013-11-23 18:57:38	Miles	There's a folder first thing called "enemy"
2013-11-23 18:57:45	Espyo	a warning should pop up if you downloaded it from the non-official website
2013-11-23 18:58:02	Espyo	oh, so it's not in the depths of the Pikmin 2 file tree labyrinth?
2013-11-23 18:58:16	Espyo	it was hell to find the Treasure Hoard and Piklopedia icons, at least
2013-11-23 18:59:16	Prezintenden	lol
2013-11-23 18:59:41	Prezintenden	okay so i did have dolphin installed it was on my desktop and i used that somehow? yeah anyway...
2013-11-23 19:00:15	Espyo	also the thing with the other website is that at one point, one of the admins was banned from the Dolphin crew for some reason, but he closed the as-of-then official website from the others
2013-11-23 19:00:29	Espyo	and now he refuses to take it down because he's generating ad revenue from the others' hard work
2013-11-23 19:00:39	Prezintenden	life's good
2013-11-23 19:02:27	Prezintenden	okay sry was in german for some stupid reason
2013-11-23 19:02:51	Prezintenden	....I actually wrote sry I've been playing too much league of legends <_<
2013-11-23 19:03:21	Espyo	heh
2013-11-23 19:03:27	Espyo	hah
2013-11-23 19:03:35	Espyo	reminds me of when I was— brb
2013-11-23 19:04:38	--	BetaMaster64 is now known as AFK-DOS
2013-11-23 19:05:58	Espyo	—playing Age of Empires and Minecraft all the time
2013-11-23 19:06:13	Espyo	I would go on IRC and Skype and the like, and press T or Enter before typing anything
2013-11-23 19:06:28	Prezintenden	hahah
2013-11-23 19:06:34	Espyo	it's even more funny when I press T to talk on AoE, and Enter on Minecraft
2013-11-23 19:07:32	Prezintenden	wow what does this stuff do
2013-11-23 19:07:52	Prezintenden	anyway haven't found any ini files for enemies. that IS what I'm looking for right?
2013-11-23 19:08:13	Miles	No
2013-11-23 19:09:06	Miles	enemy > parm > decompress the file there
2013-11-23 19:09:39	Espyo	oh
2013-11-23 19:10:46	Prezintenden	decompress how
2013-11-23 19:12:42	Espyo	gonna need a tool for that
2013-11-23 19:12:54	Espyo	can't remember where to find it
2013-11-23 19:12:59	Espyo	what format are the files? .arc?
2013-11-23 19:13:52	Prezintenden	.szs
2013-11-23 19:15:28	Espyo	right
2013-11-23 19:15:33	Espyo	let me see if I still remember what tool I use
2013-11-23 19:15:36	Espyo	and where to find it
2013-11-23 19:16:06	Espyo	http://www.amnoid.de/gc/ here
2013-11-23 19:16:13	Espyo	extracting a .szs generates a .arc, IIRC
2013-11-23 19:16:27	Espyo	and a yay0
2013-11-23 19:16:42	Espyo	it's kind of a deep rabbit hole, but it shouldn't be too complicated to extract everything
2013-11-23 19:19:31	Prezintenden	good thing i started IT or else i would have needed to ask you how to navigate in the shell
2013-11-23 19:19:38	Prezintenden	half a year well spent
2013-11-23 19:20:04	Espyo	hehe
2013-11-23 19:20:13	Espyo	wait, college or high school?
2013-11-23 19:22:51	Prezintenden	college
2013-11-23 19:23:12	Espyo	hmm
2013-11-23 19:23:24	Prezintenden	got it
2013-11-23 19:24:04	Prezintenden	we got a list with the enemy names?
2013-11-23 19:26:44	Espyo	kinda, yeah
2013-11-23 19:26:59	Espyo	only English to internal name, though
2013-11-23 19:27:08	Prezintenden	i can't find range what
2013-11-23 19:27:17	Prezintenden	not even in chappy
2013-11-23 19:27:29	Espyo	to know a character's internal name, go on [[Piklopedia]], click on an enemy's icon file, and you'll get the name there
2013-11-23 19:27:49	Espyo	I wrote the name and location of all icon files in the ISO, this includes the internal name of the enemy
2013-11-23 19:27:58	Espyo	are the other values labeled?
2013-11-23 19:28:05	Espyo	like HP and the like
2013-11-23 19:29:46	Prezintenden	heheh, nope
2013-11-23 19:30:49	Espyo	well, the range must be there somewhere
2013-11-23 19:31:05	Espyo	aren't the labeled with Japanese? or maybe garbage characters
2013-11-23 19:31:08	Espyo	because file encoding yay
2013-11-23 19:31:18	Prezintenden	yeah got  a lot of keanji here
2013-11-23 19:31:23	Prezintenden	*kanji
2013-11-23 19:31:27	Espyo	right
2013-11-23 19:31:34	Espyo	...run that through Google Translator, I guess
2013-11-23 19:31:57	Prezintenden	heheh
2013-11-23 19:32:24	Prezintenden	well hello there
2013-11-23 19:32:34	Prezintenden	yeah, should have thought of that myself, durr
2013-11-23 19:33:10	Prezintenden	{fp09} 4 400.000000 # territory {fp10} 4 50.000000 # home range {fp11} 4 70.000000 # private distance {fp12} 4 500.000000 # sight distance {fp25} 4 50.000000 # high visibility {fp13} 4 90.000000 # view angle {fp14} 4 500.000000 # search distance {fp26} 4 50.000000 # search high {fp15} 4 90.000000 # search angle
2013-11-23 19:33:20	Prezintenden	well, so much to there being only 2
2013-11-23 19:34:16	Prezintenden	it also lists white pikmin damage btw
2013-11-23 19:35:07	Espyo	hah!
2013-11-23 19:35:09	Espyo	amazing
2013-11-23 19:35:14	Espyo	oh wow, that's not constant?
2013-11-23 19:35:27	Espyo	why didn't we dig into this before?
2013-11-23 19:35:35	Espyo	well, some of us might, but never put it to use
2013-11-23 19:35:49	Espyo	this is specially useful to me so I can know what kind of attributes to have for enemy types, for the Pikmin fangame engine
2013-11-23 19:37:49	Prezintenden	you mean not knowing that white damage differs? no, we knew that. i did, at least, pretty sure most did too
2013-11-23 19:38:14	Prezintenden	mi les and green for sure
2013-11-23 19:39:46	Espyo	I didn't know
2013-11-23 19:39:51	Espyo	and it's not mentioned on the wiki, afaik
2013-11-23 19:44:04	Prezintenden	sight distance and search distance seem to be the important ones, they're way smaller for dwarf bulborbs
2013-11-23 19:45:24	Espyo	ah
2013-11-23 19:46:12	Prezintenden	what is earthquake faint time...
2013-11-23 19:46:50	Prezintenden	"time" is right, i actually know that kanji, no clue about the rest though
2013-11-23 19:47:08	Prezintenden	earth-something time
2013-11-23 19:50:19	Espyo	used where? for enemies?
2013-11-23 19:50:24	Espyo	does it appear in the data of all of them?
2013-11-23 19:56:19	Prezintenden	yep, for all of them
2013-11-23 19:56:28	Prezintenden	earthquake faint established is always the same, time is different
2013-11-23 19:56:47	Prezintenden	GAH
2013-11-23 19:56:50	Prezintenden	PRUPLE STUN
2013-11-23 19:56:55	Prezintenden	*purple...
2013-11-23 19:57:01	Prezintenden	what else could it be
2013-11-23 19:57:42	Prezintenden	can doodlebugs be stunned... no... but they have a faint time
2013-11-23 19:57:42	Espyo	ah haha
2013-11-23 20:00:56	Prezintenden	all enemies have it, but not plants. but i wouldn't know what else it could be
2013-11-23 20:01:10	Prezintenden	interesting that some are stunned longer than others
2013-11-23 20:06:13	Espyo	yeah
2013-11-23 20:06:31	Espyo	I'll write a script of sorts that gets all of that data out
2013-11-23 20:06:39	Espyo	so we can compare it nice and cleanly with a table
2013-11-23 20:32:34	@J	oh, I didn't check here for the last couple of hours
2013-11-23 20:32:37	@J	did I miss anything?
2013-11-23 20:33:06	Espyo	quite a bt
2013-11-23 20:33:08	Espyo	*bit
2013-11-23 20:41:10	@J	[18:51:01] Espyo J's taking care of it
2013-11-23 20:41:12	@J	I am?
2013-11-23 20:41:21	@J	[19:19:31] Prezintenden good thing i started IT or else i would have needed to ask you how to navigate in the shell
2013-11-23 20:41:27	Espyo	you're the only one who can do scripts on the wiki
2013-11-23 20:41:52	@J	there's also a thing in Windows where you can shift-right-click in a directory to show the context menu with an option to open one there
2013-11-23 20:42:18	@J	you mean because you don't have the rights to edit the page, or what?
2013-11-23 20:42:41	@J	also, 'plan to maybe do it some day' != 'taking care of it'
2013-11-23 20:43:42	Espyo	oh yeah, I learned the shift+right click thing some days ago
2013-11-23 20:43:47	Espyo	then forgot about it
2013-11-23 20:43:58	Espyo	nobody has rights to add scripts except admins
2013-11-23 20:48:58	@J	well, I'm not the only admin here
2013-11-23 20:50:06	Espyo	you're the only one who's active and knows JS
2013-11-23 20:50:12	Espyo	also you talked about it
2013-11-23 20:50:16	Espyo	so all of those factors together...
2013-11-23 20:50:51	@J	I'm pretty disappointed you haven't already written it and just sent it to me
2013-11-23 20:50:55	@J	slacking as usual
2013-11-23 20:51:11	Espyo	I'm actually not entirely following your logic
2013-11-23 20:51:12	Espyo	on the talk page
2013-11-23 20:51:14	Espyo	ok, let's see
2013-11-23 20:51:27	Espyo	the script that /hides/ the video executes after the video is loaded
2013-11-23 20:51:30	Espyo	that's normal
2013-11-23 20:51:50	Espyo	but can't we just set the style to be hidden in the first place?
2013-11-23 20:51:50	Espyo	you can do inline CSS in mediawiki text
2013-11-23 20:51:54	Espyo	and then the script adds a onclick to unhide it

2013-11-23 21:00:09	@J	mm, it's possible, but I don't know how the script works
2013-11-23 21:00:11	@J	you could try it
2013-11-23 21:03:30	Espyo	maybe eventually

2013-11-23 21:22:35	@J	it vaguely works if you do this
2013-11-23 21:22:38	@J	<table class="collapsible collapsed"><tr><th>aoeu</th></tr><tr style="display: none;"><td>aoeu</td></tr></table>
2013-11-23 21:29:50	Espyo	ah
2013-11-23 21:29:52	Espyo	what's the catch?
2013-11-23 21:33:07	@J	the code looks kind of bad, you have to have a header row, and I haven't tested it doesn't actually load it with display:none
2013-11-23 21:37:29	Espyo	I see tables with single cells all the time
2013-11-23 21:46:21	Espyo	http://i.crackedcdn.com/phpimages/photoshop/7/7/1/216771_v1.jpg I need help, I don't understand this at all

2013-11-23 22:43:16	@J	wait, maybe this is possible using that
2013-11-23 22:45:07	@J	for some reason I thought you couldn't style rows without doing this

2013-11-25 18:23:13	@PikFan	yay
2013-11-25 18:27:12	@PikFan	after I get 100 ACs + RC upgrade, I'm going for 240 cursors + Sextillion Fingers upgrade
2013-11-25 18:27:32	@PikFan	and to finish buying the cookies
2013-11-25 18:28:00	Espyo	right
2013-11-25 18:28:00	@PikFan	also only achievement I haven't unlocked is Let's never bake again
2013-11-25 18:28:12	@PikFan	do you have that achievement?
2013-11-25 18:28:41	Espyo	I have all achievements except for Neverclick and the shadow ones
2013-11-25 18:29:05	@PikFan	._o
2013-11-25 18:29:16	@PikFan	so your CpS is +1,000,000,000,000?

2013-11-25 18:30:03	 *	@PikFan 's jaw drops
2013-11-25 18:30:24	@PikFan	but wouldn't that need like +2,500 heavenly chips?
2013-11-25 18:30:45	Espyo	not really
2013-11-25 18:30:49	Espyo	just patience, I guess
2013-11-25 18:30:53	Espyo	unless I'm misremembering
2013-11-25 18:30:54	Espyo	give me a few
2013-11-25 18:30:58	@PikFan	okay
2013-11-25 18:31:16	Espyo	then I'll tell you for sure
2013-11-25 18:35:47	@PikFan	imo, they should add achievements for the number of cookie clickes
2013-11-25 18:35:50	@PikFan	*clicks
2013-11-25 18:37:21	@PikFan	like, 500 clicks, 1,000 clicks, 10,000 clicks, 25,000 clicks, and 50,000 clicks
2013-11-25 18:37:35	@PikFan	and a shadow achievement could be 100,000 clicks
2013-11-25 18:37:47	Espyo	manual clicks?
2013-11-25 18:37:50	@PikFan	mhm
2013-11-25 18:38:17	Espyo	don't they have those already?
2013-11-25 18:38:39	@PikFan	no
2013-11-25 18:39:20	@PikFan	five achievements are for making cookies from clicks, and another five achievements are for the number of cursors owned

2013-11-25 20:26:39	@J	...okay, in VLC, if you press R it says 'Random: on'
2013-11-25 20:27:09	Espyo	that sounds apt
2013-11-25 20:27:21	@J	but what does it do?
2013-11-25 20:27:31	@J	in the keybindings, the description is just 'Random'
2013-11-25 20:27:50	@J	oh, maybe it's a playlist thing?
2013-11-25 20:28:43	Espyo	yeah
2013-11-25 20:28:50	Espyo	that's what I thought right away
2013-11-25 20:29:10	@J	I see
2013-11-25 20:29:18	@J	so you were just laughing at my lack of thinkingness
2013-11-25 20:31:33	Espyo	I then thought that you knew that, but knew it by the name "shuffle"
2013-11-25 20:31:38	Espyo	but if you want me to laugh, I can
2013-11-25 20:31:43	Espyo	throat is kinda broken, but...
2013-11-25 20:32:19	@J	I just couldn't think what it could be making random
2013-11-25 20:32:28	@J	so it's just a 'make something random' function
2013-11-25 20:32:31	@J	which is pretty random
2013-11-25 20:41:47	Espyo	randomly shuffle the video's frames
2013-11-25 20:41:57	Espyo	but yeah, the idea of VLC with a playlist is kinda weird
2013-11-25 20:43:01	Espyo	ok, so fever dreams are an actual thing, and I'm not insane
2013-11-25 20:43:15	Espyo	every time I've had a fever caused by this throat infection, I have confusing and stressing dreams
2013-11-25 20:43:22	Espyo	normally combining several things that happened that day
2013-11-25 20:43:35	Espyo	yesterday, I played a lot of Pikmin 2, to check the kill cap for enemy attacks
2013-11-25 20:43:37	@J	yeah, the playlist implementation is pretty poor; I don't use it
2013-11-25 20:43:42	Espyo	so my dream involved organizing Pikmin in some way
2013-11-25 20:43:45	Espyo	but it was so confusing
2013-11-25 20:43:46	@J	not that I listen to music anyway
2013-11-25 20:43:52	Espyo	it involved caves, and some secret cult...
2013-11-25 20:44:01	Espyo	I use Winamp for anything music-related
2013-11-25 20:44:34	@J	hmm, did I tell about the time I was ill and had loads of dreams that involved waking up in my room?
2013-11-25 20:44:48	@J	some were really scary because I couldn't move
2013-11-25 20:44:55	@J	and they were so realistic
2013-11-25 20:46:01	Espyo	I think I vaguely remember that
2013-11-25 20:46:13	@J	one of them had a walking forest outside
2013-11-25 20:46:34	@J	another turned my desk area into a big window that some guy outside melted/phased through

2013-11-26 19:39:30	Espyo	no, what I have now
2013-11-26 19:39:48	Espyo	then again I did spend something like that amount some days ago
2013-11-26 19:40:04	@PikFan	oh, another clarification
2013-11-26 19:40:23	@PikFan	is that the cookies for this game or the all time cookies
2013-11-26 19:40:31	Los_Plagas	PikFan, you lured Espyo in too?
2013-11-26 19:40:37	@PikFan	no
2013-11-26 19:40:44	@PikFan	he started playing before me
2013-11-26 19:40:51	Los_Plagas	I have so many that my cookie count is almost entirely /letters/
2013-11-26 19:41:08	@PikFan	...which is odd because I thought you had more than that, Espyo
2013-11-26 19:41:14	Espyo	yeah...
2013-11-26 19:41:19	Espyo	well, I didn't play the past week
2013-11-26 19:41:41	@PikFan	right, because of your computer situation
2013-11-26 19:41:45	@PikFan	...OH
2013-11-26 19:41:58	@PikFan	it erased your cookies?
2013-11-26 19:42:03	Espyo	no no
2013-11-26 19:42:06	Espyo	I used a different computer
2013-11-26 19:42:08	Espyo	so I couldn't play
2013-11-26 19:42:15	@PikFan	oh
2013-11-26 19:42:15	Espyo	unless I manually carried the save file back and forth
2013-11-26 19:42:16	Espyo	so meh
2013-11-26 19:42:40	Espyo	...ok, Pikmin 2 enemies are very complex
2013-11-26 19:42:52	Espyo	I'm reading through the game files, and they have tons of parameters
2013-11-26 19:42:53	@PikFan	max deaths?
2013-11-26 19:42:57	Espyo	nope
2013-11-26 19:43:03	@PikFan	oh
2013-11-26 19:45:43	Espyo	aww, I wanted to play with these values
2013-11-26 19:45:52	Espyo	like set a Bulborb's speed to 40000 or something
2013-11-26 19:45:55	Espyo	so he'd teleport everywhere
2013-11-26 19:46:03	Espyo	but editing GCN files is confusing
2013-11-26 19:46:08	Espyo	last time I checked, anyway
2013-11-26 19:46:22	Los_Plagas	I wonder if a Wii version would be easier to adjust
2013-11-26 19:46:40	Espyo	hmm
2013-11-26 19:46:42	Espyo	not necessarily
2013-11-26 19:46:48	Espyo	Dolphin emulates both GCN and Wii just fine
2013-11-26 19:46:59	Espyo	same difficulty to open both kinds of files
2013-11-26 19:47:16	Espyo	hm, the problem mostly lies with packing .szs and .arc files
2013-11-26 19:49:38	Los_Plagas	If I could do that, then I personally would adjust it so there could be a lot more Pikmin out of the Onion at once, but that might cause major lag
2013-11-26 19:49:51	Espyo	they even have data for how strong their shakes are
2013-11-26 19:50:02	Espyo	(shakes = when they shake Pikmin off)
2013-11-26 19:50:10	Los_Plagas	Wow.
2013-11-26 19:50:16	Espyo	I think that particular value might be hardcoded, Los_Plagas
2013-11-26 19:50:20	Espyo	not in a config file
2013-11-26 19:50:23	Los_Plagas	Most likely
2013-11-26 19:50:32	Los_Plagas	Since it's quite important through the game
2013-11-26 19:50:37	Espyo	yeah
2013-11-26 19:50:42	Espyo	and it's already been established since Pikmin 1
2013-11-26 19:50:46	Espyo	so no point in making it changeable
2013-11-26 19:51:12	Los_Plagas	If you were advanced enough to make a 3D model
2013-11-26 19:51:26	Los_Plagas	Could you potentially code an entirely new enemy into the game?
2013-11-26 19:55:11	Espyo	not realistically
2013-11-26 19:55:23	Espyo	not for now, at least
2013-11-26 19:55:31	Espyo	we'd have to tell several parts of the game about the new enemy
2013-11-26 19:55:42	Espyo	the Piklopedia (or the exclusion of the enemy on the Piklopedia)
2013-11-26 19:55:48	Espyo	where it appears in the levels
2013-11-26 19:55:55	Espyo	and countless other places we don't know off
2013-11-26 19:56:16	Espyo	also we still don't know how to pack .szs and .arc and all that
2013-11-26 19:56:28	Espyo	so... I mean, it could be possible, the developers had to do it, duh
2013-11-26 19:56:37	Los_Plagas	Well of course
2013-11-26 19:56:38	Espyo	but with the existing knowledge atm, it's far from being possible
2013-11-26 19:56:54	Espyo	maybe it's a lot easier in Pikmin 3, once the Wii U game format is cracked
2013-11-26 19:57:02	Espyo	I mean, people import entirely new characters into Brawl all the time
2013-11-26 19:57:18	Espyo	err... but they don't ADD them to the game, they replace them with existing characters
2013-11-26 19:57:31	Los_Plagas	True.
2013-11-26 19:57:37	Los_Plagas	Could you do that .
2013-11-26 19:57:51	Espyo	for Brawl? there's tons I don't know about Brawl hacking
2013-11-26 19:57:59	Los_Plagas	For Pikmin
2013-11-26 20:00:38	Los_Plagas	I mean,would it be possible with all the knowledge?
2013-11-26 20:00:54	Los_Plagas	Is it locked down, or would it be entirely possible if we knew how to code it?
2013-11-26 20:02:30	Espyo	if we knew how, it'd be possible, yeah

2013-11-26 20:17:24	@J	we don't?
2013-11-26 20:17:30	Espyo	pretty sure we don't...
2013-11-26 20:17:38	@J	there's spec for it, I thought
2013-11-26 20:18:00	Espyo	hm
2013-11-26 20:18:10	Espyo	well, nobody made a packer, that's for sure
2013-11-26 20:18:14	Espyo	or if they did, it's well hidden
2013-11-26 20:18:19	Espyo	or not even released
2013-11-26 20:18:39	@J	yeah, last time we talked about this, I started writing a rarc creator, then ended up with an extractor
2013-11-26 20:18:45	@J	and never did the creator part
2013-11-26 20:19:35	Espyo	heh
2013-11-26 20:19:38	Espyo	don't remember that
2013-11-26 20:20:00	Espyo	ok, so I Google Translate'd the parameters on the enemy files
2013-11-26 20:20:05	Espyo	some are obvious, but most aren't
2013-11-26 20:20:07	Espyo	need suggestions
2013-11-26 20:20:18	Espyo	"Hits around the Pikmin"?
2013-11-26 20:20:34	Espyo	this parameter is not near any other parameter that sounds related
2013-11-26 20:20:49	Espyo	"Shock attack possible range"
2013-11-26 20:20:58	Espyo	found before "Shock attack possible angle of attack"
2013-11-26 20:21:12	Espyo	"Warning time", found before the petrification period
2013-11-26 20:21:22	@J	'possible' sounds like a mistranslation there
2013-11-26 20:21:35	@J	probably 'maximum' 'base' or something
2013-11-26 20:21:35	Espyo	"Hip drop damage", found after the petrification period, and before the Purple Pikmin stomp stun chance
2013-11-26 20:21:39	@J	*maximum or base
2013-11-26 20:21:42	Espyo	right, I figured

2013-11-26 20:21:48	Espyo	still doesn't help a huge lot
2013-11-26 20:21:56	@J	stun damage?
2013-11-26 20:22:18	Espyo	don't think stunning causes damage per se
2013-11-26 20:22:23	Espyo	you can stun without hitting the enemy directly
2013-11-26 20:22:56	@J	landing damage of purples
2013-11-26 20:23:05	Espyo	hmm
2013-11-26 20:23:35	Espyo	"Blow shake off *", in which the asterisk is A, 1, B, 2, C, 3 or D
2013-11-26 20:23:43	Espyo	sounds like something multiplayer-related, but...
2013-11-26 20:26:13	Espyo	hm, dweevils have an attribute called "treasure attack"
2013-11-26 20:26:52	Espyo	it's not the treasure's "HP"
2013-11-26 20:26:57	Espyo	that's another attribute
2013-11-26 20:29:21	@J	something to do with when they try to pick up a treasure?
2013-11-26 20:30:30	Espyo	maybe

2013-11-26 22:53:47	Espyo	uh
2013-11-26 22:53:52	Espyo	I think it worked just right the first time
2013-11-26 22:54:06	Espyo	I did a C++ program to go through the whole folder and return a wikitext list with all the enemy info
2013-11-26 22:54:20	Espyo	C++ is horrible at fetching filesystem info
2013-11-26 22:54:36	Espyo	and it looks like the entire program worked fine the first time
2013-11-26 23:05:53	@J	in Python: for fn in os.listdir(dir): with open(fn) as f: do_stuff(f.read())
2013-11-26 23:06:36	@J	in Bash: for f in dir/*; cat "$f" | do_stuff; done
2013-11-26 23:09:21	Espyo	yep
2013-11-26 23:09:25	Espyo	in C++...
2013-11-26 23:10:02	Espyo	http://pastebin.com/VWBGQew3
2013-11-26 23:10:19	Espyo	you can omit the check to add to the list if it's a folder or not, but that still only saves 2 lines
2013-11-26 23:13:02	@J	in Python: os.isdir(fn)
2013-11-26 23:13:23	@J	I think it's [ -d "$f" ] in Bash, but I'd have to check
2013-11-26 23:13:31	@J	so yeah, when are you learning another language?
2013-11-26 23:13:42	Espyo	when I have time
2013-11-26 23:16:05	@J	hey, you know JavaScript, right?
2013-11-26 23:16:16	@J	if you learn Node.js, this stuff wouldn't be so bad in that
2013-11-26 23:17:15	@J	I think it's: fs.readDir(dir, function (err, fns) { _.each(fns, doStuff) })
2013-11-26 23:17:27	@J	that's using _ as Underscore.js, which is nice
2013-11-26 23:17:33	Espyo	I do
2013-11-26 23:17:43	Espyo	...Javascript can access folders now?
2013-11-26 23:17:55	@J	JavaScript isn't just a browser language
2013-11-26 23:18:05	@J	you just need some libraries, which Node provides
2013-11-26 23:18:11	Espyo	hmmmm
2013-11-26 23:18:20	@J	it also has a module system and package manager with online repository
2013-11-26 23:18:37	Espyo	well, that's new to me
2013-11-26 23:18:48	@J	it's mostly used for servers because of the focus on asynchronous I/O
2013-11-26 23:19:12	@J	that is, it lets you do lots of things in a single thread at once, making it very lightweight
2013-11-26 23:19:41	Espyo	shouldn't it be multiple threads?
2013-11-26 23:20:23	@J	no, a single thread
2013-11-26 23:20:29	@J	that's what makes it lightweight
2013-11-26 23:20:54	@J	you do things while waiting for I/O
2013-11-26 23:21:22	Espyo	asynch I/O in a single thread?
2013-11-26 23:21:26	@J	like JavaScript's setTimeout is asynchronous and runs in the same thread
2013-11-26 23:21:27	@J	yes
2013-11-26 23:22:00	@J	it just extends that idea, and it works very well along with JS's first class lambdas
2013-11-26 23:22:54	Espyo	ah
2013-11-26 23:22:58	Espyo	awesome
2013-11-26 23:23:11	Espyo	...aww, don't tell me mediawiki doesn't allow huge tables to be sortable
2013-11-26 23:23:29	Espyo	I decided to make this program create a mediawiki table so I could sort it on the wiki
2013-11-26 23:23:36	Espyo	instead of writing more things to sort
2013-11-26 23:23:51	Espyo	but the table isn't being sorted, even though it's a "wikitable sortable" class table
2013-11-26 23:24:49	@J	maybe it's just loading
2013-11-26 23:24:50	Espyo	there's a mediawiki glitch
2013-11-26 23:24:59	Espyo	in which if a line on a table is like:
2013-11-26 23:25:11	Espyo	!Red Bulborb || Forest of Hope
2013-11-26 23:25:20	Espyo	the "Forest of Hope" cell will also be considered a header cell
2013-11-26 23:25:28	@J	not sure that's a glitch
2013-11-26 23:25:35	Espyo	don't really know if it's a glitch, but it's not intuitive
2013-11-26 23:25:36	@J	it's part of the syntax
2013-11-26 23:25:46	@J	well, it's a header row, right?
2013-11-26 23:25:48	Espyo	if I want it so that the other cell isn't a header, I need to break a line
2013-11-26 23:25:50	@J	makes sense
2013-11-26 23:25:53	Espyo	hmm, I suppose
2013-11-26 23:26:31	@J	for the sorting, try another wiki?
2013-11-26 23:26:38	Espyo	ah, done
2013-11-26 23:26:51	Espyo	it was because the rows were being considered header rows
2013-11-26 23:26:54	Espyo	eesh, picky
2013-11-26 23:27:04	Espyo	ok, let's see what kind of things I can find
2013-11-26 23:27:39	Espyo	http://pastebin.com/cx7Dhvi9 because you probably want to find stuff as well
2013-11-26 23:28:16	Espyo	panmodoki has the lowest amount of health...
2013-11-26 23:28:30	Espyo	 1.0... gotta find out what panmodoki is
2013-11-26 23:28:34	Espyo	I think it's the Breadbug
2013-11-26 23:28:50	Espyo	yep
2013-11-26 23:29:00	Espyo	how weird, 1.0 HP?
2013-11-26 23:30:33	Espyo	"Per with map" makes no sense sorted
2013-11-26 23:30:39	Espyo	can't find any correlation with anything
2013-11-26 23:32:14	Espyo	Dwarfs have the highest damage scales
2013-11-26 23:32:24	Espyo	I think those are how much the model scales when being hit
2013-11-26 23:32:40	Espyo	it can't be a multiplier, because 300x is ridiculous
2013-11-26 23:33:22	@J	um...
2013-11-26 23:33:31	@J	http://sprunge.us/VBAA
2013-11-26 23:33:38	@J	did this a few years ago
2013-11-26 23:33:51	Espyo	...
2013-11-26 23:34:38	Espyo	ok, we should put all this info to use though
2013-11-26 23:35:12	@J	http://sprunge.us/hFAU
2013-11-26 23:35:18	@J	also a thing, but not as detailed
2013-11-26 23:35:44	Espyo	I'll need that to double-check the Treasure Hoard icons
2013-11-26 23:35:47	Espyo	because I know they're wrong
2013-11-26 23:38:05	@J	I may as well send you the whole thing while I'm looking at it
2013-11-26 23:38:12	@J	not sure if there's anything else useful though
2013-11-26 23:38:51	Espyo	there's more?
2013-11-26 23:38:53	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/P2%20disk%20data.zip
2013-11-26 23:39:02	@J	not data, just documentation on some file formats
2013-11-26 23:39:06	@J	and not much of it
2013-11-26 23:39:47	Espyo	right
2013-11-26 23:40:16	@J	oh, there is another thing

2013-11-27 21:03:52	@PikFan	hi J
2013-11-27 21:04:18	@J	hey
2013-11-27 21:09:28	Espyo	haven't checked it yet
2013-11-27 21:09:49	Espyo	uh, but I know there are 4 tiers of Purple Pikmin stun vulnerability
2013-11-27 21:09:50	Espyo	IIRC
2013-11-27 21:10:02	Espyo	there's 0, 0.01, 0.1 and 0.3
2013-11-27 21:10:12	Espyo	some enemies, like the Breadbugs, can't be stunned
2013-11-27 21:10:25	Espyo	others are rarely stunned, I think it's only the Pileated Snagret
2013-11-27 21:10:35	Espyo	then others are commonly or less commonly stunned
2013-11-27 21:10:38	Espyo	so that info should go somehwere
2013-11-27 21:10:40	Espyo	*somewhere
2013-11-27 21:10:55	Espyo	I'm /really/ thinking about creating a Pikmin 2 data card to add to articles

2013-11-27 21:30:04	Espyo	but Cookie Chain ends up giving more profit in the end, I think

2013-11-27 22:56:23	Espyo	there are petitions already to make it open-source

2013-11-28 21:43:40	@J	okay, I think I managed 12 catches on the crazy juggling thing once
2013-11-28 21:44:13	@J	but the inaccuracies get ridiculous and I end up with scrunched up arms and twisted legs every time
2013-11-28 21:47:53	Espyo	of course
2013-11-28 21:48:01	Espyo	that's what I imagined the gif on the wikipedia page to end up as
2013-11-28 21:48:24	Espyo	on an unrelated note: it's incredibly hard getting into the Submerged Castle
2013-11-28 21:50:01	@J	?
2013-11-28 21:50:18	Espyo	the Submerged Castle is all the way up there on the Perplexing Pool
2013-11-28 21:50:25	Espyo	I /just/ want to gather 100 Blues and go there
2013-11-28 21:50:26	Espyo	but nope
2013-11-28 21:50:35	Espyo	Shearwigs, Bulbears, Snitchbugs
2013-11-28 21:50:39	Espyo	nothing can EVER leave me alone
2013-11-28 21:50:42	@J	oh, right
2013-11-28 21:54:42	Espyo	and now I wait for the Waterwraith
2013-11-28 21:57:58	Miles	...Why aren't you going left by where the electric gate was
2013-11-28 21:58:16	Espyo	I still get greeted with the Bulbear
2013-11-28 21:58:26	Miles	1 out of the 3 things you're complaining about
2013-11-28 21:58:27	Espyo	also there are Crawmads there
2013-11-28 21:58:34	Espyo	but yeah, that is the path I did eventually take
2013-11-28 21:58:54	Espyo	couldn't really throw all 100 blues over to the slanted platform, enemies kept pressuring me
2013-11-28 22:27:10	Espyo	...huh
2013-11-28 22:27:13	Espyo	there really /is/ one
2013-11-28 22:27:25	Espyo	there's a Cloaking Burrow-nit under the ground in Pikmin 2's title screen
2013-11-28 22:27:34	Espyo	I think it only appears on certain seasons
2013-11-28 22:39:04	@J	I'm sure I've seen that before
2013-11-28 22:43:18	Espyo	I pointed out the place I saw it from on the todo
2013-11-28 22:43:43	Espyo	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpqNoutP38U I think I linked you to it before adding it to the todo though

2013-11-28 22:53:05	Espyo	on Dolphin, luckily
2013-11-28 22:53:14	Espyo	but still, I can't get into the Hole of Heroes this way
2013-11-28 22:53:20	Espyo	and I happen to really need to
2013-11-28 23:11:40	Espyo	hmm, Dolphin 4.0 works
2013-11-28 23:42:18	Espyo	phew, did it
2013-11-28 23:42:33	Espyo	I just confirmed that the Raging Long Legs can squash your entire army in a single stomp

2013-11-29 19:07:45	@J	beep
2013-11-29 19:08:03	@J	you expected Dolphin 4 not to work?
2013-11-29 19:08:09	@J	*tests*
2013-11-29 19:08:17	@J	ooh, it looks very different
2013-11-29 19:08:59	@J	actually, I think it's just a new icon set
2013-11-29 19:09:04	@J	can't tell any other difference
2013-11-29 19:10:39	@J	I feel so lazy every time I see you push some commits to GitHub
2013-11-29 19:10:48	@J	it lasts for about 30s, then I go back to procrastinating
2013-11-29 19:35:37	Espyo	last time I checked 4.0, it lagged horribly, I think
2013-11-29 19:35:46	Espyo	so I abandoned all hope in it and continued using 3.X
2013-11-29 19:36:02	Espyo	but yesterday I switched the config on 4.0 to DX9 instead of DX11
2013-11-29 19:36:08	Espyo	and it ran like the previous version of Dolphin
2013-11-29 19:36:12	Espyo	so I guess that was the problem I had
2013-11-29 19:36:31	Espyo	@commits: happens to me as well

2013-11-29 19:59:44	Espyo	hey
2013-11-29 20:00:20	@PikFan	so I'm inching closer to my goal of tripling the number of Heavenly Chips I have
2013-11-29 20:00:33	@PikFan	I have 359 HCs atm
2013-11-29 20:01:40	Espyo	that's quite a lot
2013-11-29 20:01:46	Espyo	in fact, I haven't checked if I can reset yet
2013-11-29 20:01:54	@PikFan	mm
2013-11-29 20:02:18	@PikFan	I hope I can get to 2,000 HCs so I can buy the Grease's Cups
2013-11-29 20:02:37	Espyo	I can end up with 1004
2013-11-29 20:03:28	@PikFan	I'll get 935
2013-11-29 20:03:52	@PikFan	but I need 1,064
2013-11-29 20:05:11	@PikFan	I've forfeited 64,666,843,151,060,990 cookies, so I need 501,913,156,848,939,000 cookies to get 1064 HCs
2013-11-29 20:05:25	Espyo	right
2013-11-29 20:05:50	@PikFan	in this game I've baked 373,549,874,189,429,250, so about 125,000,000,000,000,000 more cookies
2013-11-29 20:06:32	@PikFan	hmm
2013-11-29 20:06:47	@PikFan	for some reason I still haven't unlocked the seventh Halloween cookie
2013-11-29 20:06:56	@PikFan	even though I've popped 399 wrinklers
2013-11-29 20:07:12	Espyo	just luck luck luck
2013-11-29 20:07:26	@PikFan	bad luck maybe
2013-11-29 20:08:12	Espyo	yep
2013-11-29 20:15:07	@J	Espyo: ...yeah, no way your laptop supports DX11
2013-11-29 20:15:11	@J	weird that that would be the default
2013-11-29 20:15:22	Espyo	DX9 is deprecated on 4.0
2013-11-29 20:15:29	@J	fun
2013-11-29 20:16:55	@J	[19:36:31] Espyo @commits: happens to me as well
2013-11-29 20:17:04	@J	wait, you see your own commits and then feel lazy?
2013-11-29 20:17:14	Espyo	on the very rare occasions I see others' commits
2013-11-29 20:17:30	@J	that does make more sense
2013-11-29 20:17:42	Espyo	yes
2013-11-29 21:02:07	@J	http://spelunkyworld.com/ - look at that and tell me what you click to buy it
2013-11-29 21:02:24	@J	because it took me a good while to work it out
2013-11-29 21:24:01	@PikFan	finally
2013-11-29 21:24:10	@PikFan	the bat cookies were unlocked
2013-11-29 21:24:20	@PikFan	at 410 wrinklers

2013-11-29 21:37:26	Espyo	well, now that I knew I had to search slightly outside the box, I found it fairly quickly
2013-11-29 21:37:38	Espyo	but it's not too hard
2013-11-29 21:38:16	@J	it's horrible design

2013-11-29 21:39:13	Espyo	...
2013-11-29 21:39:26	Espyo	so before dinner, I was listening to a playlist, 3 hours long
2013-11-29 21:39:34	Espyo	I pause it to go dine
2013-11-29 21:39:37	Espyo	I came back, and hit play
2013-11-29 21:39:40	Espyo	it continues where it left off
2013-11-29 21:39:45	Espyo	for 5 seconds and then stops
2013-11-29 21:39:53	Espyo	that's because I only had 5 seconds of the playlist left

2013-12-01 16:05:14	@J	hey, regarding that teleporting fighter game I came up with
2013-12-01 16:05:33	Espyo	mhm
2013-12-01 16:05:41	@J	I want to try to make it possible to set up a new teleport while you're teleporting
2013-12-01 16:05:59	@J	there are 3 ways I can think of doing this:
2013-12-01 16:06:34	@J	1. charging is almost real-time (you move for almost as long as you charge) - but this makes the actual movement phase (not really a 'teleport' any more) very slow
2013-12-01 16:06:47	Espyo	right
2013-12-01 16:06:58	@J	2. the 2nd teleport is much faster, and charges faster, and you can chain them if you can do it fast enough
2013-12-01 16:07:13	Espyo	that mightn't be too good
2013-12-01 16:07:15	@J	3. your character slows down while you charge the next one
2013-12-01 16:07:20	Espyo	you do some damage, then teleport away really fast until the time is over
2013-12-01 16:07:47	Espyo	 3 would make it kinda useless, and predictable
2013-12-01 16:07:50	@J	why is that not a good thing?
2013-12-01 16:08:09	Espyo	hmm
2013-12-01 16:08:16	Espyo	I suppose it's not a bad thing
2013-12-01 16:08:21	@J	yes, 3 makes it more of a cancel than actual changing how you're going to move
2013-12-01 16:09:19	@J	for your issue with 2: you'd have to be skilled enough to hit them while moving quickly, and then charge up and release within the short time you're moving
2013-12-01 16:09:38	@J	with a sensible direction and accounting for the extra speed of this teleport over the 1st-level one
2013-12-01 16:09:57	@J	anyway, just wondering which you think makes most sense
2013-12-01 16:10:02	@J	could try them all, of course
2013-12-01 16:10:04	Espyo	right
2013-12-01 16:10:36	Espyo	charge time to teleport time has to be a no
2013-12-01 16:11:34	@J	yeah, I kind of agree
2013-12-01 16:11:51	@J	I'll obviously have to experiment with the ratio there anyway - I think the 10x I suggested before would be too much
2013-12-01 16:11:55	Espyo	mhm, mhm
2013-12-01 16:11:57	@J	maybe 3x would work better
2013-12-01 16:12:02	Espyo	yeah
2013-12-01 16:12:12	Espyo	anywhere between 3 and 6 would be good, I imagine

2013-12-01 17:25:07	@J	I opened up my laptop and turned it upside down, and a screw fell out, and I have no idea where it came from
2013-12-01 17:26:21	Espyo	ah the mystery screws
2013-12-01 17:26:34	Espyo	last time I opened mine, there was an extra screw
2013-12-01 17:27:06	@J	it's not one I took out, it was just in there, somewhere
2013-12-01 17:37:04	@J	okay, clearing out some dust took me from 5FPS to 20 in Minecraft
2013-12-01 17:37:56	@J	90C to 70C
2013-12-01 17:37:56	Testyo	90 C = 194 °F / 363.15 °K
2013-12-01 17:38:26	@J	okay, it's not 'degrees Kelvin', it's just Kelvin
2013-12-01 17:43:09	Espyo	...that it is
2013-12-01 17:43:21	Espyo	wow
2013-12-01 17:43:57	Espyo	 45C
2013-12-01 17:43:57	Testyo	45 C = 113 °F / 318.15 K
2013-12-01 17:44:03	Cactmas	o
2013-12-01 17:44:06	Cactmas	0C
2013-12-01 17:44:07	Testyo	0 C = 32 °F / 273.15 K
2013-12-01 17:44:12	Espyo	what about degrees Fahrenheit?
2013-12-01 17:44:26	Cactmas	shouldn't it be °C
2013-12-01 17:44:45	Espyo	it works for °C, ºC, C and Celsius
2013-12-01 17:44:48	@J	yeah, it's degrees for C and F, but not K
2013-12-01 17:44:58	@J	I think he means Testyo should say the degrees
2013-12-01 17:45:00	Espyo	to make it so he converts more things instead of ultra-specific numbers and units
2013-12-01 17:45:05	@J	40°C
2013-12-01 17:45:06	Testyo	40 °C = 104 °F / 313.15 K
2013-12-01 17:45:10	@J	oh, he just copies you
2013-12-01 17:45:11	@J	okay then
2013-12-01 17:45:13	Cactmas	-40C
2013-12-01 17:45:13	Testyo	-40 C = -40 °F / 233.15 K
2013-12-01 17:45:18	Espyo	hmm, right
2013-12-01 17:45:20	@J	-5K
2013-12-01 17:45:20	Testyo	-5 K = -278.15 °C / -4974.7 °F
2013-12-01 17:45:23	@J	haaaah
2013-12-01 17:45:28	Espyo	because he says =
2013-12-01 17:45:28	Cactmas	>-5K
2013-12-01 17:45:28	Testyo	-5 K = -278.15 °C / -4974.7 °F
2013-12-01 17:45:42	Espyo	well, checking if Kelvin is negative requires an actual check
2013-12-01 17:45:54	Espyo	these conversions work with just one equation
2013-12-01 17:45:57	Espyo	no checks
2013-12-01 17:46:15	@J	how does it pick it up?
2013-12-01 17:46:17	Espyo	just pretend Testyo is a bot from the future, where the notion of absolute 0 is unreal
2013-12-01 17:46:18	@J	3.4K
2013-12-01 17:46:18	Testyo	3.4 K = -269.75 °C / -4823.5 °F
2013-12-01 17:46:22	@J	.4K
2013-12-01 17:46:22	Testyo	4 K = -269.15 °C / -4812.7 °F
2013-12-01 17:46:25	@J	.K
2013-12-01 17:46:26	@J	0.K
2013-12-01 17:46:30	Espyo	number, followed by any unit it recognizes
2013-12-01 17:46:39	@J	0.4.5K
2013-12-01 17:46:40	Testyo	0.4.5 K = -272.75 °C / -4877.5 °F
2013-12-01 17:46:42	@J	...
2013-12-01 17:46:44	Espyo	between the number and unit, there can be a space or nothing
2013-12-01 17:46:50	Espyo	that's... bizarre
2013-12-01 17:46:58	@J	5.0.5C
2013-12-01 17:46:59	Testyo	5.0.5 C = 41 °F / 278.15 K
2013-12-01 17:47:16	@J	I'm guessing you did [\.0-9]* or something
2013-12-01 17:47:19	Espyo	well, my bot can calculate numbers with two decimals
2013-12-01 17:47:25	Espyo	no regex, manual checking
2013-12-01 17:47:25	@J	5C
2013-12-01 17:47:25	Testyo	5 C = 41 °F / 278.15 K
2013-12-01 17:47:29	@J	it just ignores it
2013-12-01 17:47:33	@J	5.5aC
2013-12-01 17:47:35	@J	5.5a C
2013-12-01 17:47:42	Espyo	this was before I learned how to do regex in C++
2013-12-01 17:47:43	@J	5.5.C
2013-12-01 17:47:44	@J	5.5. C
2013-12-01 17:47:46	Espyo	(which is still now)
2013-12-01 17:47:50	@J	5.5.a C
2013-12-01 17:48:09	@J	you're using a standard library function, then?
2013-12-01 17:48:40	Espyo	to recognize numbers?
2013-12-01 17:48:50	@J	yeah
2013-12-01 17:48:54	Espyo	no, I just grab digits, commas and dots
2013-12-01 17:48:56	Espyo	and -
2013-12-01 17:48:57	@J	...oh
2013-12-01 17:49:01	Espyo	all manual
2013-12-01 17:49:10	@J	and you disallow the last character being a .
2013-12-01 17:49:14	@J	.C
2013-12-01 17:49:18	Espyo	yep
2013-12-01 17:49:27	@J	..5C
2013-12-01 17:49:27	Testyo	5 C = 41 °F / 278.15 K
2013-12-01 17:49:28	Espyo	unfortunately I don't disallow multiple . on the same number...
2013-12-01 17:49:32	@J	.5C
2013-12-01 17:49:32	Testyo	5 C = 41 °F / 278.15 K
2013-12-01 17:49:35	@J	wait
2013-12-01 17:49:43	@J	oh, I didn't even realise it got that wrong before
2013-12-01 17:49:58	Espyo	 1.2.3.4.5.6.7cm
2013-12-01 17:49:58	Testyo	1.2.3.4.5.6.7 cm = 0.47256 in / 0.03936 ft / 0.631579 Olimar-heights / 1.9992 TRY-heights
2013-12-01 17:50:08	Espyo	ignore the last one
2013-12-01 17:50:09	@J	TRY?
2013-12-01 17:50:10	Cactmas	o
2013-12-01 17:50:11	Espyo	that's relevant on another channel
2013-12-01 17:50:12	@J	...

2013-12-02 22:55:56	Espyo	it has 4 dots
2013-12-02 22:55:58	@J	...
2013-12-02 22:56:02	@J	so it counts twice?
2013-12-02 22:56:07	Espyo	so there's "..." with a "." after, and "..." with a "." before
2013-12-02 22:56:09	Espyo	I guess it does
2013-12-02 22:56:09	@J	so 10 dots counts 8 times

2013-12-02 22:57:26	Espyo	...but the algorithm is kinda complex: it changes to times/day or times/minute accordingly
2013-12-02 22:57:29	Espyo	or weeks or months
2013-12-02 22:57:35	@J	then my ... one is going to be ridiculous

2013-12-02 22:58:22	Espyo	...why does it have no Linux examples?
2013-12-02 22:58:29	Espyo	guess it must depend on the...

2013-12-02 22:58:36	Espyo	the thing that Gnome is

2013-12-02 22:59:02	Espyo	besides, the bar is animated on windows

2013-12-02 23:04:43	Espyo	ah
2013-12-02 23:05:28	@J	http://peter.sh/examples/?/html/meter-progress.html
2013-12-02 23:06:08	@J	[22:58:29] Espyo guess it must depend on the...
2013-12-02 23:06:08	@J	[22:58:32] Espyo what's the word...
2013-12-02 23:06:08	@J	[22:58:36] Espyo the thing that Gnome is
2013-12-02 23:06:16	@J	Desktop Environment, but it doesn't
2013-12-02 23:06:30	@J	depends on the toolkit Firefox uses, which looks like it's GTK
2013-12-02 23:06:40	@J	also depends on your widget theme
2013-12-02 23:07:02	Espyo	oh, I see
2013-12-02 23:07:03	Espyo	makes sense
2013-12-02 23:07:30	Espyo	it looks pretty neat
2013-12-02 23:07:39	Espyo	but hey, if it ain't broken...
2013-12-02 23:07:46	Espyo	besides, the style doesn't fit the rest of the page
2013-12-02 23:07:52	Espyo	but that IS noted for the future, so cheers
2013-12-02 23:07:54	@J	yeah, I was just pointing it out
2013-12-02 23:20:34	@J	okay, I'm starting to realise that using a wooden floor where the contraption beneath uses lava might not have been the best idea
2013-12-02 23:21:14	Espyo	depends on what you want to do
2013-12-02 23:21:17	Espyo	makes for a neat trap
2013-12-02 23:21:47	@J	no matter what you want to do, if the stuff you've placed randomly burns away, you're doing it wrong
2013-12-02 23:23:20	Espyo	that's just it
2013-12-02 23:23:23	Espyo	a burglar comes around
2013-12-02 23:23:25	Espyo	thinks the floor is safe
2013-12-02 23:23:30	Espyo	and it starts crumbling under his feet
2013-12-02 23:23:35	Espyo	...it's a very poor trap, but hey
2013-12-02 23:23:38	@J	...more like a burglar comes around, finds there's no floor
2013-12-02 23:24:06	Espyo	you have to be fast, that's the downfall
2013-12-02 23:24:13	Espyo	have to be fast to set up a slow trap
2013-12-02 23:24:21	@J	yes
2013-12-02 23:24:40	@J	the fire doesn't seem to spread, and it seems to get one block every 10 minutes or so
2013-12-02 23:24:49	Espyo	that's really painfully slow
2013-12-02 23:25:22	@J	it's probably because I put some bricks between the wood and the lava
2013-12-02 23:27:14	Espyo	oh, and the lava still reaches through?
2013-12-02 23:28:30	@J	yeah
2013-12-02 23:29:29	@J	got to go; goodnight
2013-12-02 23:31:14	Espyo	night

2013-12-04 17:31:23	Miles	What?
2013-12-04 17:32:06	Espyo	you know the orange "3" icon, made out of flowers, on the top-right of the article?
2013-12-04 17:32:28	Espyo	there's an icon like that duplicated on the same line as the "In Pikmin 3" section's title
2013-12-04 17:35:02	Espyo	oh, and a 2 on the "In Pikmin 2" line, duplicate from the top-right of the article as well

2013-12-04 18:52:13	@J	you actually replied to that guy?
2013-12-04 18:52:13	Testyo	Oh, J, you have a memo from Espyo, written on 04/12/2013 17:26 (GMT), saying: http://www.pikminwiki.com/Sunseed_Berry why is there a Pikmin 3 icon on the "In Pikmin 3" section?.
2013-12-04 18:52:32	Espyo	eh
2013-12-04 18:52:46	@J	you mean why would you want one there, or what code's adding it?
2013-12-04 18:54:17	Espyo	what code's adding it
2013-12-04 18:56:15	@J	it's probably because both infoboxes add it
2013-12-04 18:56:33	Espyo	I figured
2013-12-04 18:56:39	Espyo	question is, what can we do to fix it?
2013-12-04 18:58:22	@J	yeah, let me look into it
2013-12-04 18:59:05	@J	I think I remember adding a parameter to infoboxes to disable it
2013-12-04 19:00:34	@J	oh, no, but it's in the todo document
2013-12-04 19:00:41	@J	Infoboxes:
2013-12-04 19:00:46	@J	a clash=y parameter to put ‘(<type>)’ after the infobox title, for pages with multiple infoboxes (see Sunseed Berry - that would have ‘Sunseed Berry (treasure)’ and ‘Sunseed Berry (fruit)’)
2013-12-04 19:01:28	@J	the weird positioning will be because it uses an id, so more than one gives unspecified behaviour
2013-12-04 19:01:45	Espyo	ah
2013-12-04 19:02:25	@J	so that shouldn't be too hard, just need it on all the relevant infoboxes
2013-12-04 19:02:37	Espyo	mhm
2013-12-04 19:02:39	@J	the page should then call {{game icons}} directly, as Sunseed Berry already does
2013-12-04 19:02:40	Espyo	so, all
2013-12-04 19:02:53	Espyo	there are only like 8 infoboxes
2013-12-04 19:03:01	@J	mm...how many even use the template?
2013-12-04 19:03:13	Espyo	infoboxes?
2013-12-04 19:03:16	Espyo	thousands
2013-12-04 19:03:43	@J	9 of them, it seems
2013-12-04 19:03:45	@J	wait what
2013-12-04 19:03:50	@J	no, how many infoboxes use {{game icons}}
2013-12-04 19:03:54	@J	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Special%3AWhatLinksHere&target=Template%3AGame+icons&namespace=10

2013-12-04 19:04:32	@J	also, I lied when I said 9

2013-12-04 19:12:36	Espyo	yeah, it can

2013-12-04 19:12:51	Testyo	Done. I'm now recording how many times Espyo says this incredibly long sentence with multiple words.
2013-12-04 19:12:53	@J	how do I do it again?
2013-12-04 19:12:55	@J	ah
2013-12-04 19:12:55	Espyo	Testyo: server

2013-12-04 19:13:07	Testyo	Done. I'm now recording how many times J says I lied.
2013-12-04 19:13:14	@J	is it case-sensitive?
2013-12-04 19:13:18	Espyo	no
2013-12-04 19:13:21	@J	and does it match only words?
2013-12-04 19:13:25	Espyo	unless you want me to, I have to set it manually
2013-12-04 19:13:28	Espyo	also no

2013-12-04 19:13:34	Espyo	also manually settable
2013-12-04 19:13:37	@J	so just 'lied' would match 'replied'?
2013-12-04 19:13:41	Espyo	Testyo: why'd you take so long to give me the webpage?
2013-12-04 19:13:46	Espyo	hmm
2013-12-04 19:13:48	Espyo	wait
2013-12-04 19:13:53	Espyo	I think by default it's the whole word
2013-12-04 19:13:59	Espyo	and I can specify for it not to
2013-12-04 19:14:05	@J	okay, that makes more sense
2013-12-04 19:14:09	Espyo	http://89.153.92.223:8080/Pikipedia/word_records yep, 0 hits
2013-12-04 19:14:10	@J	does that work with multiple words?
2013-12-04 19:14:19	@J	(ie., does it match wourd boundaries at the ends of words?)
2013-12-04 19:14:20	Espyo	think so, but only the first and last'd work
2013-12-04 19:14:21	Espyo	let me try

2013-12-04 19:32:27	Espyo	not so much for the y/n itself, because nobody writes that normal

2013-12-05 21:07:48	@J	just calculate both directions and choose the shortest one?
2013-12-05 21:08:15	Espyo	 0 -> 360 crossover
2013-12-05 21:08:17	Espyo	and vice versa
2013-12-05 21:08:32	Espyo	I think I got the code down, but now it's giving problems elsewhere
2013-12-05 21:10:35	Espyo	dinner now
2013-12-05 21:14:55	@J	you just subtract 360 from the destination, find the nearer of the two, then do %= 360 again
2013-12-05 21:15:18	@J	wait, I mean...
2013-12-05 21:15:39	@J	no, that's it, just given dest in (0, 2pi], choose the nearer of dest and dest-2pi
2013-12-05 21:16:39	@J	dest = min([(abs(dest - current), dest), (abs(dest - 2pi - current), dest - 2pi)])[1]
2013-12-05 21:17:54	@J	then every frame, 'angle = r * (dest - angle)' for some r < 1
2013-12-05 21:19:25	@J	if you want your angle to always be above 0, then maybe each frame do 'if angle < 0 { angle += 2pi; dest += 2pi }'

2013-12-05 21:44:56	Espyo	slightly more complicated than that
2013-12-05 21:45:18	Espyo	first, the angle could go nuts, way above 2pi
2013-12-05 21:45:23	Espyo	there's a function to normalize it, though
2013-12-05 21:45:33	Espyo	secondly, C++ is /horrible/ at modulus
2013-12-05 21:45:38	Espyo	no negatives allowed, no floats allowed
2013-12-05 21:46:01	Espyo	but other than that, it's fairly enough what I'm doing
2013-12-05 21:46:10	Espyo	something else is amiss now
2013-12-05 21:46:22	Espyo	and while I don't fix that, I can't quite tell for sure if the smooth turning thing is working
2013-12-05 21:50:17	@J	double mod (double x, double div) { return x - div * (int) (x / div); }
2013-12-05 21:50:19	@J	does that work?

2013-12-05 21:50:43	@J	doesn't account for div=0, obviously
2013-12-05 22:00:12	Espyo	hmm
2013-12-05 22:00:23	Espyo	I remember doing a "better" mod some time ago
2013-12-05 22:00:31	Espyo	but I think it was just for negatives
2013-12-05 22:01:46	Espyo	angle - (pi * 2) * floor(angle + pi) / (pi * 2)
2013-12-05 22:01:53	Espyo	that normalizes an angle, between -pi and pi
2013-12-05 22:02:01	Espyo	so no need for modulus either way

2013-12-05 22:15:49	@J	um...that doesn't look right at all
2013-12-05 22:16:05	@J	I think maybe you meant to divide by 2pi inside the floor()
2013-12-05 22:16:16	@J	in which case it becomes basically my mod() function
2013-12-05 22:19:38	Espyo	no no, that works
2013-12-05 22:19:46	Espyo	got it from the internet
2013-12-05 22:19:51	Espyo	and that part of my code works
2013-12-05 22:20:02	Espyo	ok, I stripped down all I did regarding this smooth angling
2013-12-05 22:20:10	Espyo	to try to understand the underlying problem
2013-12-05 22:20:13	Espyo	because something else is wrong
2013-12-05 22:20:21	Espyo	and from what I gather, if I set the angle directly, everything is fine
2013-12-05 22:20:36	Espyo	if I call a function that sets the angle directly and nothing else... it doesn't work
2013-12-05 22:31:08	@J	[22:19:38] Espyo no no, that works

2013-12-05 22:33:36	@J	just think about it; it's complete nonsense

2013-12-05 23:36:07	Espyo	right, I ended up checking if the difference is over pi
2013-12-05 23:36:20	@J	...looks kind of hacky
2013-12-05 23:36:20	Espyo	*as well
2013-12-05 23:36:24	@J	but I know it worked
2013-12-05 23:36:31	@J	hmm, not hacky
2013-12-05 23:36:34	Espyo	I see that being used on the few examples I found online
2013-12-05 23:36:37	@J	'clunky', I guess

2013-12-05 23:36:52	Testyo	Hi everyone!
2013-12-05 23:36:55	Espyo	hm
2013-12-05 23:37:14	@J	the .1 is how slowly it moves
2013-12-05 23:37:17	Espyo	right
2013-12-05 23:37:28	@J	it moves 10% of the distance every frame
2013-12-05 23:37:32	Espyo	ok, so right now everything is fine in theory, on my code
2013-12-05 23:37:34	@J	that looked quite nice
2013-12-05 23:37:39	Espyo	I need to do something more elaborate
2013-12-05 23:38:02	Espyo	it must move the minimum between the rotation speed and the rotation necessary to reach the target angle
2013-12-05 23:38:21	Espyo	but because my units are in angles per second, I need to extract how much to spin per frame
2013-12-05 23:38:30	Espyo	which should be ridiculously easy: just divide by the framerate
2013-12-05 23:38:40	Espyo	but well, that just ended up in that crazy disco I posted before
2013-12-05 23:39:07	Espyo	and it is because of that, 'cause not taking into account the framerate makes the characters spin fine, but constantly
2013-12-05 23:39:12	Espyo	or something like that
2013-12-05 23:39:59	@J	it looks nicer to do an easing like this than to use a constant rotation speed
2013-12-05 23:40:02	@J	easier, too
2013-12-05 23:40:46	Espyo	but not precise enough for what I want
2013-12-05 23:41:02	Espyo	I want the creator of the game to set what the rotation speed of something is
2013-12-05 23:41:09	Espyo	stuff like Bulborbs are meant to spin slowly
2013-12-05 23:41:14	Espyo	giving a chance to strike their behinds
2013-12-05 23:41:20	@J	hmm
2013-12-05 23:41:35	@J	okay, but just using a constant speed will look bad
2013-12-05 23:41:41	@J	you need an acceleration
2013-12-05 23:41:57	@J	but I guess that'll be easier to tweak once you have it working
2013-12-05 23:42:26	@J	this is similar to dealing with friction, where you don't want the friction to be great enough to start moving the thing in the opposite direction
2013-12-05 23:42:54	@J	you just cap the change in speed it causes to the current speed
2013-12-05 23:43:34	Espyo	I know
2013-12-05 23:43:42	Espyo	but acceleration is not used in either Pikmin game
2013-12-05 23:43:45	Espyo	at least for rotations
2013-12-05 23:44:00	Espyo	and yeah @friction

2013-12-05 23:45:20	@J	not for the captains, no
2013-12-05 23:45:26	@J	but enemies take a while to start moving
2013-12-05 23:45:34	Espyo	hmm
2013-12-05 23:45:39	Espyo	still rotation-wise?
2013-12-05 23:45:45	@J	yeah

2013-12-05 23:45:45	Testyo	Hi everyone!
2013-12-05 23:45:47	@J	maybe
2013-12-05 23:45:53	Espyo	don't think they do
2013-12-05 23:45:57	Espyo	and here's my reasoning
2013-12-05 23:46:05	Espyo	you know how in the title screen of P2 you can control a Bulborb?
2013-12-05 23:46:12	Espyo	if you press the C-stick either left or right, he spins
2013-12-05 23:46:16	Espyo	doesn't look like he has acceleration to it
2013-12-05 23:46:21	@J	hmm
2013-12-05 23:46:22	Espyo	and it looks just like it does in-game
2013-12-05 23:46:27	@J	you think?
2013-12-05 23:46:30	Espyo	still, I suppose a bit of acceleration wouldn't hurt, no
2013-12-05 23:46:36	Espyo	but it'll have to be something to implement later on
2013-12-05 23:46:45	Espyo	if I don't hurry up and get the rest of the engine going, I'll never get anywhere
2013-12-05 23:46:51	@J	well, there's certainly a delay before moving at all
2013-12-05 23:46:58	Espyo	there is, I feel that, yeah
2013-12-05 23:47:06	@J	but yeah, maybe it's just the animations that make it look like acceleration
2013-12-05 23:47:09	@J	anyway, I should go
2013-12-05 23:47:09	@J	bye

2013-12-06 21:44:29	Espyo	first, http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Rock_Pikmin.jpg delete this please
2013-12-06 21:44:36	Espyo	so I can add a replacement
2013-12-06 21:44:38	Espyo	I want that filename
2013-12-06 21:47:16	@J	just reupload
2013-12-06 21:47:28	@J	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Special:Upload&wpDestFile=Rock_Pikmin.jpg&wpForReUpload=1
2013-12-06 21:48:07	Espyo	can't
2013-12-06 21:48:12	Espyo	extension is a .png
2013-12-06 21:51:39	@J	uh...
2013-12-06 21:51:49	@J	then why do you want to call it jpg?
2013-12-06 21:52:04	Espyo	I don't
2013-12-06 21:52:07	Espyo	it's the other way around
2013-12-06 21:52:11	Espyo	that file is a jpg
2013-12-06 21:52:18	Espyo	I want to upload a .png
2013-12-06 21:52:24	Espyo	both have the same name sans extension
2013-12-06 21:53:31	@J	so?
2013-12-06 21:53:49	@J	has MediaWiki changed so that you can't have both?
2013-12-06 21:53:54	@J	you definitely used to be able to
2013-12-06 22:02:02	Espyo	yep, can't have both
2013-12-06 22:02:06	Espyo	or... was it just a warning?
2013-12-06 22:02:16	Espyo	also, off-topic, but http://www.pikminwiki.com/Downloadable_content
2013-12-06 22:02:53	@J	probably a warning
2013-12-06 22:03:11	@J	also, you said 'two things'
2013-12-06 22:03:34	Espyo	second one incoming soon
2013-12-06 22:03:42	Espyo	well, it says "please pick a different name"
2013-12-06 22:03:50	Espyo	nothing about specifically forcing or specifically not forcing
2013-12-06 22:03:54	Espyo	thought he form is not disabled

2013-12-06 22:05:19	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Rock_Pikmin.png so much for that
2013-12-06 22:05:23	Espyo	you could still delete the jpg
2013-12-06 22:09:09	@J	also, you could've just used another name
2013-12-06 22:10:47	Espyo	didn't wanna
2013-12-06 22:11:18	Espyo	forgot to mention, you could still delete the jpg... because it's super tiny
2013-12-06 22:11:38	Espyo	second thing:
2013-12-06 22:11:45	Espyo	the next Ludum Dare is just around the corner
2013-12-06 22:11:46	Espyo	it's next week
2013-12-06 22:11:53	Espyo	and I'm participating, I think
2013-12-06 22:12:01	Espyo	unless someone tells me they'll need me this weekend
2013-12-06 22:18:50	@J	already did delete it
2013-12-06 22:19:02	@J	yeah, if you say so
2013-12-06 22:19:14	@J	I plan to go to a local meetup for it
2013-12-06 22:19:23	@J	except I have a work dinner thing on the Saturday evening

2013-12-06 22:25:51	Espyo	ah, just a meetup then
2013-12-06 22:26:19	Espyo	I've got a few questions to ask
2013-12-06 22:26:41	Espyo	would you recommend not programming on Friday, so that your brain is all ready for Saturday?
2013-12-06 22:40:10	@J	not really
2013-12-06 22:40:21	@J	but get a good amount of sleep
2013-12-06 22:40:48	@J	in fact, programming with libraries you intend to use should keep them fresher in your mind
2013-12-06 22:41:48	@J	you probably should've asked all your questions in one go, if I'm going to be so slow to answer...
2013-12-06 22:42:44	Espyo	right
2013-12-06 22:42:56	Espyo	uh... I actually can't think of any other question
2013-12-06 22:54:07	@J	so juggling 5 balls is really hard
2013-12-06 22:55:52	@J	but with the crazy thing I showed you before, I can sometimes manage as many as 15 catches, and sometimes most of them are smooth
2013-12-06 23:00:05	Espyo	not bad
2013-12-06 23:00:07	Espyo	needs more though
2013-12-06 23:13:15	@J	of course
2013-12-06 23:14:02	@J	I do this weird thing on a particular catch for some reason: instead of just moving my hand across, upturned, I move it all the way over and back under the ball first
2013-12-06 23:14:08	@J	and I have no idea why and I can't stop it
2013-12-06 23:14:16	@J	and that often messes up

2013-12-07 21:45:32	Prezintenden	uh so the drivers on the site are the same you have?
2013-12-07 21:46:30	Espyo	dunno, might be
2013-12-07 21:46:34	Espyo	uploading atm, anyway
2013-12-07 21:46:58	Espyo	normally CDs with stuff like this have a load of things
2013-12-07 21:47:03	Espyo	but luckily this one was organized just nicely
2013-12-07 21:47:10	Espyo	with a folder just for the driver's installer
2013-12-07 21:47:22	Espyo	and no other folder had anything to do with the drivers, as is sometimes the case
2013-12-07 21:47:26	Espyo	so I'm sure this is all you need
2013-12-07 21:47:29	Espyo	if these drivers work, I mean
2013-12-07 21:47:33	Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Grabber%20drivers.7z
2013-12-07 21:47:56	Espyo	and I've got dinner now
2013-12-07 21:48:00	Espyo	brb
2013-12-07 21:48:29	Prezintenden	yay thanks man
2013-12-07 21:53:13	Prezintenden	ah it's the same i had before
2013-12-07 22:13:53	Prezintenden	poop, nothing gets recognized
2013-12-07 22:14:11	Prezintenden	I'll try it on a friends laptop in a few days when he's back

2013-12-08 13:41:27	@J	okay...what happened there?
2013-12-08 13:41:43	@J	I see my own ping timeout
2013-12-08 13:41:55	@J	and also it just said the time is 8am
2013-12-08 13:42:24	Espyo	...huh
2013-12-08 13:42:36	@J	hmm, I think I might've pressed ctrl-a,pageup, which messed everything up
2013-12-08 13:42:46	Espyo	can't quite see how that would...
2013-12-08 13:42:50	Espyo	wait, what's ctrl+a on a terminal?
2013-12-08 13:42:55	@J	this is in tmux
2013-12-08 13:43:02	Espyo	oh
2013-12-08 13:43:13	@J	in screen and tmux, shortcuts start with a special first stroke
2013-12-08 13:43:26	@J	for screen, it's ctrl-a, for tmux ctrl-b but I've changed it to ctrl-a
2013-12-08 13:43:31	@J	so it does _something_
2013-12-08 13:43:34	Espyo	oh
2013-12-08 13:43:37	@J	but no idea what
2013-12-08 13:43:56	@J	anwayw, hi
2013-12-08 13:43:57	Espyo	yeah, some programs on windows have ctrl+k as a first stroke
2013-12-08 13:43:58	@J	*anyway
2013-12-08 13:44:00	Espyo	hi
2013-12-08 13:44:08	@J	hmm, like what?
2013-12-08 13:44:20	Espyo	visual studio
2013-12-08 13:44:28	Espyo	I think ctrl+k, ctrl+f is format
2013-12-08 13:44:33	Espyo	or rather, a poor attempt at formatting
2013-12-08 13:44:43	Espyo	it just tabulates automatically, nothing else
2013-12-08 13:46:30	@J	I think ctrl-k in Firefox goes to the main page for your default search engine
2013-12-08 13:46:35	@J	which is kind of weird
2013-12-08 13:47:28	Espyo	oh?
2013-12-08 13:47:32	Espyo	but slightly useful
2013-12-08 13:47:36	Espyo	uh, nope
2013-12-08 13:47:49	Espyo	ctrl+k put the focus on the search engine box
2013-12-08 13:48:17	@J	hmm, maybe because I don't have one of those
2013-12-08 13:48:25	Espyo	oh
2013-12-08 13:49:24	Espyo	lunch
2013-12-08 14:23:49	Espyo	ok, so how do we GMTians handle the Ludum Dare schedule?
2013-12-08 14:25:55	@J	start on Saturday, whenever you get up
2013-12-08 14:26:00	@J	it's like 2am, isn't it?
2013-12-08 14:26:19	Espyo	 2am on Saturday?
2013-12-08 14:26:22	Espyo	haven't checked
2013-12-08 14:26:37	@J	that's what it usually is
2013-12-08 14:26:51	Espyo	starts in 11 hours (and 5 days)
2013-12-08 14:26:57	Espyo	so yeah, 2AM
2013-12-08 14:27:22	Espyo	hm, then it ends Monday at 2AM, right?
2013-12-08 14:29:54	@J	yeah
2013-12-08 14:30:23	Espyo	oh, so it's no big deal
2013-12-08 14:30:34	Espyo	we wake up on Saturday, work, then Sunday, work
2013-12-08 14:30:38	Espyo	we have 2 days just like anyone else
2013-12-08 14:30:47	Espyo	 2 "awake" days, I mean
2013-12-08 14:30:54	Espyo	ok, good
2013-12-08 14:30:58	Espyo	oh, another thing
2013-12-08 14:31:11	Espyo	the rules state that you can use existing code, but you have to share it on a blog post
2013-12-08 14:31:45	Espyo	so, do I have to share it before I start, does it have to be something specifically aimed towards helping everybody, or can it just be a snippet of code I made a long time ago to do something tiny, or...?
2013-12-08 14:32:41	@J	yes, pretty sure you're meant to declare any code before you start
2013-12-08 14:32:54	Espyo	right
2013-12-08 14:33:02	Espyo	though, I'm not sure about what I'm gonna use
2013-12-08 14:33:03	@J	speaking of which, you've just reminded me to do that
2013-12-08 14:33:21	Espyo	I made some quick functions to split words, trim trailing spaces, etc. in C++
2013-12-08 14:33:28	Espyo	but there are dozens of them
2013-12-08 14:33:31	Espyo	do I have to share it all?
2013-12-08 14:33:34	Espyo	I don't mind sharing, of course
2013-12-08 14:33:55	Espyo	but 80% of my distribution content is gonna be random code that could or could not be useful
2013-12-08 14:34:13	Espyo	or is it just that for something so pathetically simple as a split function, it's really not necessary?
2013-12-08 14:44:03	@J	I would say more significant pieces of code
2013-12-08 14:44:10	@J	little functions, not so much
2013-12-08 14:44:27	@J	of course, those things already exist in most languages
2013-12-08 14:46:38	Espyo	right
2013-12-08 14:48:08	@J	TBH, it's really more about what you feel is necessary
2013-12-08 14:48:32	@J	everything's done in good faith, and it's all just for fun
2013-12-08 14:49:11	Espyo	right, right

2013-12-08 18:32:30	Espyo	ok, funny but stressing scenario
2013-12-08 18:32:46	Espyo	the way Pikmin follow the leader is kinda as follows: there's a spot they all gather around
2013-12-08 18:32:50	Espyo	that spot follows the leader like a dog
2013-12-08 18:32:59	Espyo	and the Pikmin follow the spot
2013-12-08 18:33:14	Espyo	to implement the C-stick movement, I just move the spot to another place
2013-12-08 18:33:27	Espyo	and when the C-stick is released, the spot goes back to chasing the captain
2013-12-08 18:33:42	Espyo	the problem is, when the C-stick is held all the way, say, to the right, the spot teleports there
2013-12-08 18:33:58	Espyo	and the Pikmin, that used to be near the captain, start making their way to the right, which is still around 2 seconds away
2013-12-08 18:34:19	Espyo	when I release the C-stick, the spot starts chasing the captain, which happens in a smooth movement (i.e. no teleport)
2013-12-08 18:34:30	Espyo	while the spot is making its way back, the Pikmin are still going right to chase the spot
2013-12-08 18:34:43	Espyo	only when the spot and Pikmin meet halfway through do the Pikmin actually turn back
2013-12-08 18:34:59	Espyo	so basically: if I hold the C-stick right, the Pikmin go right, but when I release it, they take a bit to come back
2013-12-08 18:35:14	Espyo	if I make the spot's chasing speed infinite, that solves that, but creates another problem
2013-12-08 18:35:30	Espyo	when the captain's walking around, the spot just instantly jumps around
2013-12-08 18:35:42	Espyo	and you can tell by the Pikmin brutely changing direction
2013-12-08 18:36:37	@J	I think I'd have to see it to get how it looks bad
2013-12-08 18:37:11	Espyo	ok then
2013-12-08 18:37:27	@J	maybe have each Pikmin pick a point somewhere near the spot, and if, when the spot moves, that's still a valid point, it doesn't change destination
2013-12-08 18:37:56	Espyo	...............................
2013-12-08 18:38:00	Espyo	then there's ANOTHER thing I don't get
2013-12-08 18:38:06	Espyo	somehow, magically, it assumes 1 = 0.5
2013-12-08 18:38:10	Espyo	don't know where
2013-12-08 18:38:22	Espyo	normally, when you move Pikmin all the way with the C-stick, they go as far as the cursor can reach
2013-12-08 18:38:29	Espyo	except sometimes they go halfway
2013-12-08 18:38:33	Espyo	that's a problem for another time
2013-12-08 18:40:34	Espyo	woah clunky framerate
2013-12-08 18:41:02	@J	maybe they get tired
2013-12-08 18:41:05	@J	and stop for a rest
2013-12-08 18:41:32	Espyo	that's not how you make mindless slaves at all
2013-12-08 18:42:16	Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/spot.wmv ignore the framerate
2013-12-08 18:42:36	Espyo	the red dot represents the group's center
2013-12-08 18:42:41	Espyo	the so called spot I talked aout
2013-12-08 18:42:42	Espyo	*about
2013-12-08 18:42:55	Espyo	notice how the spot moves jerkily and how the Pikmin do as well
2013-12-08 18:43:19	Espyo	to make it so the Pikmin aren't always glued to Olimar's center, I made the spot follow the captain, but if the leader is too close, to not move
2013-12-08 18:43:45	Espyo	just like in the actual games: if you have a group around you and you walk amongst them, they won't move
2013-12-08 18:43:54	Espyo	but once you make a certain distance the group will start moving
2013-12-08 18:46:00	Espyo	for comparison, here's how it is with the spot moving smoothly https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/spot2.wmv
2013-12-08 18:46:24	Espyo	hmm
2013-12-08 18:46:50	Espyo	I might make it so that if you let go the C-stick, the spot instantly goes to the edge of the "don't follow" range
2013-12-08 18:47:32	Espyo	problem is I'm gonna have to create a new variable just to know what the previous C-stick value was, to compare if the stick's been released
2013-12-08 18:47:49	Espyo	I can't just do that on the event handling part because there are too many ways to control the group in terms of input
2013-12-08 18:48:10	Espyo	holding space to make them follow the cursor, joystick axis left, right, up, down, to make them follow that direction and ignore the cursor, ...
2013-12-08 18:48:23	Espyo	but as everybody knows, creating more variables is poop
2013-12-08 18:49:00	@J	eating dinner, I'll read the stuff in a bit

2013-12-08 19:02:15	Espyo	they're jerky enough for me to not like it
2013-12-08 19:02:27	@J	you mean just starting and stopping?
2013-12-08 19:02:31	@J	or the fact they all move together?
2013-12-08 19:02:42	Espyo	no, all moving together is kinda natural
2013-12-08 19:02:45	Espyo	gotta kinda fix that later
2013-12-08 19:02:47	Espyo	I mean when they turn
2013-12-08 19:03:00	Espyo	you see them quickly change direction, and not smoothly
2013-12-08 19:03:18	@J	[18:46:50] Espyo I might make it so that if you let go the C-stick, the spot instantly goes to the
2013-12-08 19:03:18	@J	edge of the "don't follow" range
2013-12-08 19:03:22	@J	what does this mean?
2013-12-08 19:03:34	Espyo	hang on, I did just that, and I'll record a bit
2013-12-08 19:03:45	@J	okay, so just make the spot move smoothly?
2013-12-08 19:04:13	Espyo	I must make the spot move smoothly when it's following the captain, so that the Pikmin don't change direction jerkily
2013-12-08 19:04:24	Espyo	but when it's regarding the C-stick, the spot should move instantly
2013-12-08 19:04:31	Espyo	I'll show you the final thing, it's all working well now
2013-12-08 19:05:27	Espyo	gaah, what is it with this framerate?
2013-12-08 19:06:39	Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/spot_final.wmv
2013-12-08 19:09:47	@J	oh, I didn't see that spot2 video
2013-12-08 19:11:07	@J	I didn't mean make it move to its destination smoothly, but when following the captain, it should be updated more often
2013-12-08 19:11:30	@J	but yeah, that one looks okay
2013-12-08 19:11:45	Espyo	it's not updated normally
2013-12-08 19:11:48	@J	though the solution sounds like the sort of thing that causes unexpected problems further down the line
2013-12-08 19:11:52	Espyo	it uses the same code mobs use to chase stuff
2013-12-08 19:12:02	Espyo	the spot chases Olimar, so it goes with its natural speed
2013-12-08 19:12:36	@J	I don't understand why that means it only updates infrequently
2013-12-08 19:12:48	@J	the destination only updates infrequently, that is
2013-12-08 19:13:01	Espyo	because it won't update unless Olimar is out of range
2013-12-08 19:13:20	Espyo	I can cook something up that makes understanding this a lot better
2013-12-08 19:19:19	Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/spot_explain.wmv
2013-12-08 19:19:32	Espyo	also the spot and its "don't chase" radius are grey now
2013-12-08 19:19:38	Espyo	sure is better than red
2013-12-08 19:21:23	@J	so update it every frame Olimar moves
2013-12-08 19:22:01	Espyo	it's not so much me telling it where to put the spot on each frame
2013-12-08 19:22:11	Espyo	as it is the spot being programmed to follow Olimar
2013-12-08 19:22:19	Espyo	but either way, it does update every frame
2013-12-08 19:22:34	Espyo	the problem was with the C-stick, making the spot slowly move back to Olimar caused some delay on the Pikmin's movement
2013-12-08 19:23:18	@J	yes, I get how it works, and I'm questioning why it needs to work like that
2013-12-08 19:23:32	@J	but I guess it doesn't really matter any more
2013-12-08 19:23:59	Espyo	I could tell the Pikmin to go to the group spot, but offset the position to whatever the C-stick tells them
2013-12-08 19:24:19	Espyo	but the chase algorithm already takes into account a point plus an offset
2013-12-08 19:24:21	@J	it should just be a case of: every frame, if the c-sticks held put the spot there, if not put it a set distance behind Olimar
2013-12-08 19:24:24	Espyo	and adding another offset on top of that...
2013-12-08 19:24:40	Espyo	yep, that's what I ended up doing
2013-12-08 19:25:00	@J	*c-stick's
2013-12-08 19:25:01	Espyo	the difficulty was that if the C-stick is not being held, the spot should chase Olimar naturally
2013-12-08 19:25:04	-->	RingtailedFox (Ringtailed@p57-35-8-400.home.cgocable.net) has joined #pikipedia
2013-12-08 19:25:14	Espyo	I had to make it so that if it's the first frame in which you release, THEN the spot's put near Olimar
2013-12-08 19:25:33	Espyo	normal chase = too slow, teleport = too jerky
2013-12-08 19:25:43	@J	don't you want to put it near Olimar every frame the c-stick isn't held?
2013-12-08 19:25:47	@J	not just the first frame
2013-12-08 19:25:53	Espyo	so I had to make it chase on normal circumstances, but when the group isn't meant to follow the C-stick any more, teleport
2013-12-08 19:26:06	Espyo	I do, but that's controlled by the chasing
2013-12-08 19:26:11	Espyo	and not me manually placing it there instantly
2013-12-08 19:26:54	@J	well, that's exactly my point, once again
2013-12-08 19:27:00	@J	why does it have to use the chase logic?
2013-12-08 19:27:08	@J	it seems a very simple case so there's no point
2013-12-08 19:27:23	Espyo	well, one simple reason
2013-12-08 19:27:33	Espyo	when you're on the group spot's radius, the group spot can't move
2013-12-08 19:27:44	Espyo	remember how in the games, if you move amongst the group, the group doesn't move?
2013-12-08 19:28:03	Espyo	it's easier to just consider the group spot a mob and give it a chase algorithm, with a set radius that makes it stop chasing
2013-12-08 19:28:25	Espyo	otherwise... yeah, just updating the position every time to be near Olimar works fine
2013-12-08 19:28:48	@J	hmm, I see
2013-12-08 19:29:31	Espyo	the whole group movement is still not exactly how it is in the games, but...
2013-12-08 19:29:32	Espyo	it's close enough
2013-12-08 19:29:46	Espyo	I can't tell for sure how it works in the games, and it's not super deterministic
2013-12-08 19:29:52	Espyo	they just kinda "meh, whatever, I'll move"
2013-12-08 20:02:26	Espyo	uh, I forgot how this is solved
2013-12-08 20:02:52	Espyo	I want 799.999/800 to be 0, 800/800 to be 0, and 800.001/800 to be 1
2013-12-08 20:03:04	Espyo	it involves ceilings and floors, I think, but I'm not seeing how
2013-12-08 20:09:43	Espyo	I think there's no way
2013-12-08 20:14:31	Espyo	oh, got it now
2013-12-08 20:14:37	Espyo	I wanted a ceiling of the division, minus 1
2013-12-08 20:14:48	Espyo	I did that, but I also did it to stuff I shouldn't, and I assumed everything was wrong
2013-12-08 21:48:20	Espyo	...I detest batch on Windows
2013-12-08 21:48:24	Espyo	GAH!
2013-12-08 21:48:28	Espyo	I capitalized the W!

2013-12-08 21:48:37	Espyo	what's wrong with me?
2013-12-08 22:09:46	@J	with those examples, I was going to suggest 'result = x > 800'
2013-12-08 22:10:06	@J	I thought you had Git Bash?

2013-12-08 22:31:37	@J	also you changed to $unit dir then used it in the path
2013-12-08 22:32:06	@J	no, that's the other line
2013-12-08 22:32:44	@J	anyway, you probably meant to do /arc/* at the end of the first string
2013-12-08 22:33:32	@J	the cd stuff is weird
2013-12-08 22:34:38	@J	still not entirely sure what you're trying to do
2013-12-08 22:38:20	Espyo	everything is weird...
2013-12-08 22:39:00	Espyo	the arc folder has cap_conc/arc.szs, cap_kusachi/arc.szs, etc.
2013-12-08 22:40:23	Espyo	I want to use yaz0dec.exe to extract all of those .szs files
2013-12-08 22:40:42	Espyo	in order to do it, I must first run yaz0dec.exe, then rarcdump.exe
2013-12-08 22:40:54	Espyo	finally, I want to delete the excess .rarc file it creates
2013-12-08 22:44:01	@J	for f in .../Mukki/mapunits/arc/*/arc.szs; do
2013-12-08 22:44:01	@J	    yaz0dec "$f"

2013-12-08 22:44:01	@J	done
2013-12-08 22:44:44	@J	could make something nicer, though
2013-12-08 22:44:56	Espyo	oh, but yaz0dec creates a file...
2013-12-08 22:45:01	Espyo	hm, it's like this, IIRC:
2013-12-08 22:45:12	Espyo	arc.szs -> yaz0dec
2013-12-08 22:45:28	Espyo	yaz0dec creates a arc.szs 0.rarc
2013-12-08 22:45:35	Espyo	arc.szs 0.rarc -> rarcdump
2013-12-08 22:45:42	Espyo	rarcdump creates the folder with content
2013-12-08 22:45:57	Espyo	...wait, it doesn't matter in this case
2013-12-08 22:46:06	Espyo	because it's always called arc.szs 0.rarc
2013-12-08 22:46:27	Espyo	but what if the name of the .szs varied, as was the case with the treasure hoard icons?
2013-12-08 22:47:12	@J	find . -name '*.szs' | while read f; do

2013-12-08 22:48:45	@J	it might be easier to follow if I replace the first line with

2013-12-08 22:52:44	Espyo	I'll test in a bit, Brawling right now

2013-12-09 21:16:15	@J	hard to tell what some of them are, but sure
2013-12-09 21:16:17	@J	why 96?
2013-12-09 21:16:44	Espyo	 64 was too tiny
2013-12-09 21:16:47	Espyo	 128 was too big
2013-12-09 21:17:04	Espyo	I think they're understood easily
2013-12-09 21:17:18	Espyo	you can't see details, like the fact that cap_toy has a toy pine tree made of wood on the top-right
2013-12-09 21:17:36	Espyo	(ok, you wouldn't see that regardless of the resolution, 'cause this is taken from above)
2013-12-09 21:17:45	@J	I would've gone larger
2013-12-09 21:17:47	Espyo	but it's good enough to see what they are, what their theme is, etc.
2013-12-09 21:17:55	Espyo	I don't want to strain the wiki's database
2013-12-09 21:18:02	@J	pfft, don't worry about that
2013-12-09 21:18:07	@J	MarioWiki is on the same host
2013-12-09 21:18:10	Espyo	plus I don't know how good of a job PNGCrush'd do?
2013-12-09 21:18:11	Espyo	really?
2013-12-09 21:18:14	@J	yes
2013-12-09 21:18:16	Espyo	oh, ok then
2013-12-09 21:18:18	Espyo	 128 it is
2013-12-09 21:19:33	@J	PNGCrush, no idea
2013-12-09 21:19:55	@J	not sure how it works for Windows, but I recall using some option to brute force it for slightly better results before
2013-12-09 21:20:30	@J	I personally use Trimage, and I believe there's something similar for Windows (PNGMonster?)
2013-12-09 21:20:46	@J	you might also find JPEG gives better results with these sorts of images
2013-12-09 21:20:52	@J	for which there's jpegoptim
2013-12-09 21:21:06	Espyo	hmm
2013-12-09 21:21:18	Espyo	lemme pick a random one and try a JPG
2013-12-09 21:21:23	Espyo	I'll use 100% quality JPG though
2013-12-09 21:21:32	@J	80 generally looks fine
2013-12-09 21:21:46	@J	I would try a few and see if you can actually tell the difference
2013-12-09 21:21:55	Espyo	wow, roughly half the size, at 100%
2013-12-09 21:22:10	@J	it's those last few % that add quite a bit of extra size for not much gain
2013-12-09 21:27:15	Espyo	yeah, but
2013-12-09 21:27:30	Espyo	ugh, 80% is starting to give too many artifacts
2013-12-09 21:28:11	Espyo	 90% works

2013-12-10 20:55:41	@J	sure it's an exact duplicate?
2013-12-10 20:55:47	@J	or it just looks the same?
2013-12-10 21:08:06	@J	hey...does YouTube suddenly not really work for you?
2013-12-10 21:08:26	@J	there was a flash player update today, so I'm wondering if it's that or YT
2013-12-10 21:08:59	@J	well, works, in Chromium, so probably flash
2013-12-10 21:09:01	@J	time to downgrade
2013-12-10 21:15:20	@J	ooh, there was also a Firefox update; maybe that broke it
2013-12-10 21:16:23	@J	http://gparted.org/news.php?item=170
2013-12-10 21:16:28	@J	online resizing - that's pretty nice
2013-12-10 21:42:45	Espyo	I see a few dupes
2013-12-10 21:42:57	Espyo	and what I think is that while the geometry is the same, the configs are not
2013-12-10 21:43:01	Espyo	haven't checked, but it makes sense
2013-12-10 21:43:12	Espyo	specially for stuff like item_cap_toy and cap_toy
2013-12-10 21:43:26	Espyo	(not 100% sure if those 2 exist, but a lot of them exist with that nomenclature)
2013-12-10 21:43:41	Espyo	they have the same geometry, but the item_ one must have an item (egg) in the middle
2013-12-10 21:44:09	Espyo	I've been using the same version of Flash for months now
2013-12-10 21:44:15	Espyo	it's too slow with the most recent one
2013-12-10 21:44:31	Espyo	wow, online resizing
2013-12-10 21:44:45	Espyo	can't see how the OS would blindly trust a web browser like that
2013-12-10 21:56:27	Espyo	anyway, I think I found a couple of unused units

2013-12-10 22:09:04	@J	yeah, not that type of 'online'

2013-12-10 22:10:06	Espyo	oh
2013-12-10 22:10:08	@J	for this sort of thing, you should really check out ag
2013-12-10 22:10:10	Espyo	fair enough
2013-12-10 22:10:14	@J	aka. the silver searcher
2013-12-10 22:10:22	Espyo	hmm
2013-12-10 22:10:37	@J	you've probably already done it, but it seems like a good time to bring it up
2013-12-10 22:10:44	Espyo	I was just thinking of downloading the cave info files and finding references to those units on the files
2013-12-10 22:10:50	Espyo	though I can't really find the cave data files
2013-12-10 22:11:59	Espyo	well, it seems useful, but I rarely need to search my files for stuff
2013-12-10 22:12:05	Espyo	and when I do, it's inside visual studio
2013-12-10 22:13:45	@J	how does VS do at that?
2013-12-10 22:13:57	Espyo	...horrible
2013-12-10 22:14:03	@J	don't really use an IDE, so I use this for searching instead
2013-12-10 22:14:08	Espyo	right
2013-12-10 22:14:14	Espyo	and not really just speed related horrible
2013-12-10 22:14:16	Espyo	all-around horrible
2013-12-10 22:14:17	@J	and sometimes I want to search in 3rd party code - download the source to a library I'm using
2013-12-10 22:14:20	Espyo	just like VS itself
2013-12-10 22:14:23	Espyo	right
2013-12-10 22:14:32	Espyo	could be useful to search in other places too
2013-12-10 22:14:40	@J	the thing an IDE can add, though, is links to the source in the results
2013-12-10 22:14:56	Espyo	yeah
2013-12-10 22:15:06	Espyo	VS can take up to 5 seconds to search everything
2013-12-10 22:15:19	Espyo	and the worst part is that if I change something on the current file and tell it to search for the next result
2013-12-10 22:15:25	Espyo	it retries the current document
2013-12-10 22:16:01	@J	you're talking one of your projects, with like 10 files?
2013-12-10 22:16:57	Espyo	(it depends more on the amount of code, not so much the amount of files)
2013-12-10 22:16:58	Espyo	yeah
2013-12-10 22:17:04	@J	yeah, of course
2013-12-10 22:17:07	Espyo	(also they average at 11 files now, not 10)
2013-12-10 22:17:11	@J	hmm, in that case ag will be instant
2013-12-10 22:17:16	Espyo	yeah
2013-12-10 22:17:52	@J	I use it at work, and it takes about 5s, and the repository has ~2000 files (or 40000 if you include all the generated non-code files)
2013-12-10 22:19:42	@J	mm, sometimes I use it on my entire home directory
2013-12-10 22:20:06	@J	because I remember some text from a file, but can't remember where the file is

2013-12-10 22:22:41	Espyo	happens all the time
2013-12-10 22:22:52	Espyo	anyway, I don't think the author even recognizes windows as an OS

2013-12-10 22:24:26	Espyo	oh, Notepad++ took just shy of 2 seconds
2013-12-10 22:24:41	@J	it has searching in multiple files?
2013-12-10 22:24:48	Espyo	mhm
2013-12-10 22:24:53	Espyo	also a weird thing
2013-12-10 22:25:11	Espyo	it has a checkbox titled "Follow current document"
2013-12-10 22:25:30	Espyo	I think you're meant to check that to automatically fill in the folder textbox with the directory of the currently open file
2013-12-10 22:25:47	Espyo	but I think it fills the textbox with the directory of the last "search in files" search you did

2013-12-10 22:25:59	Espyo	confusing as well

2013-12-10 22:27:53	@J	ooh, yes, from that angle
2013-12-10 22:27:57	@J	it does look familiar-ish
2013-12-10 22:28:07	@J	maybe
2013-12-10 22:28:08	Espyo	I'd replace it with transparent after taking the screenshot and cropping, but some units use alpha, which creates a horrible purple monster
2013-12-10 22:28:23	Espyo	I've never seen it, and at least the shadow would remind me of something
2013-12-10 22:28:28	@J	I think it might be used where two paths cross
2013-12-10 22:28:34	Espyo	from the name and how it looks, that unit would've fit in —
2013-12-10 22:28:35	Espyo	exactly
2013-12-10 22:28:51	@J	by which I mean, I think I recall seeing it used like that
2013-12-10 22:29:35	Espyo	hm
2013-12-10 22:29:39	Espyo	I really have no memory whatsoever
2013-12-10 22:29:56	Espyo	Notepad++ claims it appears in 22 caves
2013-12-10 22:30:04	Espyo	or cave layouts
2013-12-10 22:30:09	Espyo	still not sure how it does specific layouts
2013-12-10 22:30:10	@J	I might be confusing it with similar constructions in rusty-type areas, though
2013-12-10 22:30:34	Espyo	hmm
2013-12-10 22:30:37	Espyo	can't remember anything similar
2013-12-10 22:30:40	Espyo	heck, and I saw all units
2013-12-10 22:30:47	@J	just searched the whole ISO and found 22 references, yeah
2013-12-10 22:31:23	Espyo	that was fast
2013-12-10 22:31:41	@J	strings Pikmin\ 2.iso | grep way4_toy
2013-12-10 22:31:49	@J	didn't bother extracting
2013-12-10 22:32:08	@J	45 mentions, the first must be the filename, the others are clearly 2 per file
2013-12-10 22:32:18	Espyo	yeah
2013-12-10 22:32:19	Espyo	say, can you find where, for instance...
2013-12-10 22:32:33	Espyo	 1_NARI_hit6x6_toy.txt
2013-12-10 22:32:39	Espyo	where that is referenced? if it all?
2013-12-10 22:32:57	@J	can't find out where with this method
2013-12-10 22:33:12	Espyo	I figured... in that case, just if it's ever referenced or not
2013-12-10 22:33:18	@J	yep, running it
2013-12-10 22:33:19	Espyo	I mean...
2013-12-10 22:33:22	Espyo	in a place far away from the rest
2013-12-10 22:33:26	Espyo	guh, the files are so confusing
2013-12-10 22:33:29	@J	2 mentions, seemed close together
2013-12-10 22:33:31	@J	Espyo: {f008} -1 1_NARI_hit6x6_toy.txt # 
2013-12-10 22:33:31	@J	Espyo: {f008} -1 1_NARI_hit6x6_toy.txt # 
2013-12-10 22:33:40	Espyo	hm
2013-12-10 22:33:44	@J	uh...I think the Espyo: is because I pasted a tab
2013-12-10 22:33:48	Espyo	hehe
2013-12-10 22:33:56	Espyo	mapunits/units/ contains info on the caves...
2013-12-10 22:34:01	Espyo	AND the set of units used to build them
2013-12-10 22:34:04	Espyo	it's confusing
2013-12-10 22:34:40	Espyo	ok, this one is easy
2013-12-10 22:34:44	Espyo	it's referenced in vs3_toy
2013-12-10 22:34:48	Espyo	*vs_3_toy
2013-12-10 22:34:56	Espyo	so 4th 2P level
2013-12-10 22:35:00	Espyo	oh, I think it's 3rd, really
2013-12-10 22:35:17	Espyo	right, Carpet Plain
2013-12-10 22:35:19	Espyo	off to test
2013-12-10 22:35:49	@J	extracted it and ag found nothing, which means it's probably in an archive
2013-12-10 22:36:02	Espyo	mhm
2013-12-10 22:36:27	@J	if I run that thing to extract all archives, it should be easy
2013-12-10 22:36:29	Espyo	there are 2 other units I don't remember
2013-12-10 22:36:46	Espyo	note that I can see where it's referenced
2013-12-10 22:36:51	Espyo	but only amongst the files I have extracted
2013-12-10 22:36:55	Espyo	which are the cave unit data files
2013-12-10 22:37:02	Espyo	I was wondering if those were referenced elsewhere
2013-12-10 22:37:21	@J	but rarcdump needs modifications to work on Linux
2013-12-10 22:37:45	Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/way4_kusachi.jpg 4-way crossing on garden levels
2013-12-10 22:37:59	Espyo	I certainly don't remember a stick with a leaf with a neat little shadow
2013-12-10 22:38:06	Espyo	but the most bizarre of all
2013-12-10 22:38:08	Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/way6_tsuchi.jpg
2013-12-10 22:41:28	@J	that could be anything
2013-12-10 22:41:40	@J	what's it look like from the side?
2013-12-10 22:43:04	Espyo	which one?
2013-12-10 22:44:46	@J	the last one
2013-12-10 22:45:09	Espyo	that's just a pathway that splits into 5
2013-12-10 22:46:36	Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/bmdview2%202013-12-10%2022-46-19-73.png
2013-12-10 22:48:44	@J	no, the one you said is the most bizarre
2013-12-10 22:49:19	Espyo	that's the last one
2013-12-10 22:49:48	@J	yeah...
2013-12-10 22:49:52	@J	maybe I'm confused
2013-12-10 22:50:07	Espyo	there's the toy 4-way crossing
2013-12-10 22:50:11	Espyo	then there's the garden one with the leaf
2013-12-10 22:50:18	Espyo	then I found the 5-way split the most bizarre
2013-12-10 22:50:23	@J	oh
2013-12-10 22:50:24	Espyo	and this snapshot is of that https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/bmdview2%202013-12-10%2022-46-19-73.png
2013-12-10 22:50:31	@J	you worded it kind of weirdly, then
2013-12-10 22:50:39	@J	hmm
2013-12-10 22:50:53	Espyo	yeah, I knew I should've put a colon after "but the most bizarre of all"
2013-12-10 22:50:54	Espyo	oh well
2013-12-10 22:50:58	@J	oh, never mind, the links opened in the wrong order
2013-12-10 22:51:00	@J	fun
2013-12-10 22:51:02	Espyo	oh
2013-12-10 22:51:19	Espyo	oh!
2013-12-10 22:51:24	Espyo	way6_tsuchi is not present anywhere
2013-12-10 22:51:28	@J	way6_tsuchi is only in all_units
2013-12-10 22:51:37	Espyo	unless I misspe—
2013-12-10 22:51:38	Espyo	I did
2013-12-10 22:51:58	Espyo	ah
2013-12-10 22:52:05	Espyo	but I think that also means unused, in a way
2013-12-10 22:52:10	Espyo	no file really points to all_units
2013-12-10 22:52:14	Espyo	I think
2013-12-10 22:53:14	Espyo	yep
2013-12-10 22:53:23	Espyo	all_units points to way6_tsuchi
2013-12-10 22:53:27	Espyo	but nothing points to all_units
2013-12-10 22:53:29	Espyo	as such, this goes unused
2013-12-10 22:53:32	Espyo	hurray, discoveries!
2013-12-10 22:54:38	Espyo	the garden 4-way one is referenced in a few
2013-12-10 22:54:52	Espyo	but it's weird, the garden and the toy 4-way ones are referenced in 2-P levels
2013-12-10 22:54:59	Espyo	yet I just tried a couple of times and found nothing
2013-12-10 22:55:05	Espyo	I'm not sure how the algorithm works
2013-12-10 22:55:14	Espyo	I know there's a lot of info on what the exits are for each unit
2013-12-10 22:55:38	Espyo	so maybe it tries to randomly fill a grid with the units specified in the files
2013-12-10 22:55:46	Espyo	taking care not to overlap, not to leave exits uncovered, etc.
2013-12-10 22:55:54	Espyo	and there's just no scenario in which 4 ways cross on those maps
2013-12-10 22:57:06	Espyo	I'd like to try to replicate the algorithm they use
2013-12-10 22:57:10	Espyo	seems like a fun exercise

2013-12-10 23:19:33	Espyo	does the acronym KFES ring a bell?

2013-12-10 23:34:03	Espyo	Testyo didn't see me asking about KFES
2013-12-10 23:34:13	Espyo	so I assumed it didn't go through
2013-12-10 23:34:21	@J	I mean, I saw it in the game files

2013-12-10 23:36:12	Espyo	yeah, it's best not to talk about his sentience
2013-12-10 23:36:18	Espyo	he can sometimes be too scary with what he says

2013-12-10 23:50:32	@PikFan	so it snowed here last Friday
2013-12-10 23:50:33	Espyo	hey
2013-12-10 23:50:38	Espyo	J went to bed like 5 minutes ago
2013-12-10 23:50:45	Espyo	is snow common there?
2013-12-10 23:50:48	@PikFan	no
2013-12-10 23:50:49	Espyo	it's ultra rare here
2013-12-10 23:50:53	Espyo	last time was like 5 years ago
2013-12-10 23:50:57	@PikFan	wow
2013-12-10 23:50:57	Espyo	for the first time in probably over 50
2013-12-10 23:51:04	Espyo	snow is so awesome
2013-12-10 23:51:09	@PikFan	indeed
2013-12-10 23:51:20	@PikFan	but snow isn't that common here either
2013-12-10 23:51:41	@PikFan	once only every two winters do we get a big snowstorm
2013-12-10 23:51:49	@PikFan	we got like 8 inches
2013-12-10 23:51:49	Testyo	8 inches = 20.32 cm
2013-12-10 23:52:18	Espyo	woah
2013-12-10 23:52:29	Espyo	heh, when it snowed here, it was just some snowflakes
2013-12-10 23:52:30	Espyo	 1cm at most
2013-12-10 23:52:31	Testyo	1 cm = 0.3938 in / 0.0328 ft / 0.526316 Olimar-heights / 1.666 TRY-heights
2013-12-10 23:52:45	@PikFan	Olimar-heights?
2013-12-10 23:52:55	Espyo	I never really sa— ignore the "TRY-heights" —w large amounts of snow other than on mountaintops
2013-12-10 23:52:56	Espyo	yeah
2013-12-10 23:53:02	Espyo	 1.9cm

2013-12-10 23:54:30	@PikFan	oh, also
2013-12-10 23:54:42	@PikFan	there's this business behind my apartment complex
2013-12-10 23:54:58	@PikFan	it has this parking lot, so snow got plowed off of it
2013-12-10 23:55:14	@PikFan	resulting in these giant mounds which are like 5 feet high
2013-12-10 23:55:14	Testyo	5 feet = 152.4 cm

2013-12-10 23:58:08	Espyo	there's a corridor unit, a central room unit, a 4-way crossing unit, etc.
2013-12-10 23:58:13	Espyo	I'll add these onto the wiki soon
2013-12-10 23:58:26	Espyo	in the meantime, I found 1 unused unit and 2 that I think are unused
2013-12-10 23:58:34	@PikFan	oh, these
2013-12-10 23:58:51	Espyo	the unused one is definitely unused: http://tcrf.net/Pikmin_2#Unused_map_unit
2013-12-10 23:58:52	@PikFan	I know what you're talking about, I've seen some unused ones on  TCRF
2013-12-10 23:59:07	Espyo	no, that's cave layouts
2013-12-10 23:59:10	Espyo	I mean specific pieces
2013-12-10 23:59:13	Espyo	think of it as a puzzle
2013-12-10 23:59:24	@PikFan	oh, right
2013-12-10 23:59:24	Espyo	the game is given 2 end pieces, 1 4-way piece, 3 corridor pieces, etc.
2013-12-10 23:59:30	Espyo	and it has to assemble them randomly and correctly
2013-12-10 23:59:35	@PikFan	but yeah I know what you mean
2013-12-10 23:59:38	Espyo	on TCRF there are some unused combinations
2013-12-10 23:59:43	Espyo	I found an unused single piece
2013-12-10 23:59:48	Espyo	look at it, it's so weird
2013-12-10 23:59:52	Espyo	a path that splits into FIVE?
2013-12-11 00:00:06	Espyo	how in the world would that look appealing?
2013-12-11 00:00:15	Espyo	the ground texture is also weird, looks like grass and dirt on top of... marble?
2013-12-11 00:00:41	@PikFan	no wonder why Nintendo didn't use it
2013-12-11 00:00:46	Espyo	anyway, as for the other 2...
2013-12-11 00:00:52	Espyo	they're 4-way intersection pieces
2013-12-11 00:01:00	Espyo	for the grass and toy caves
2013-12-11 00:01:04	Espyo	that's where I need your memory
2013-12-11 00:01:05	@PikFan	mm
2013-12-11 00:01:14	Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/way4_toy.jpg https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/bmdview2%202013-12-10%2022-27-10-25.png
2013-12-11 00:01:17	Espyo	this is the toy one
2013-12-11 00:01:34	@PikFan	yeah, I've seen that one before
2013-12-11 00:01:35	Espyo	I asked some (3) people if they ever saw that, they said no
2013-12-11 00:01:41	Espyo	even though J said he kinda thinks it's familiar
2013-12-11 00:01:50	Espyo	you have? would you happen to know what cave exactly?
2013-12-11 00:02:06	@PikFan	Glutton's Kitchen and Carpet Room
2013-12-11 00:02:16	Espyo	the thing is I checked the game files to see what calls that piece (it's also why I know the 5-splitter piece is unused)
2013-12-11 00:02:23	Espyo	and a few caves call it, over 10
2013-12-11 00:02:40	Espyo	but knowing what's a cave in the final game, what's a test cave, what's a beta cave, and what's a cave that is actually just a configuration for another cave is confusing
2013-12-11 00:02:46	Espyo	so I couldn't be sure of what used that piece
2013-12-11 00:02:53	Espyo	however, I did actually notice the Carpet Room used it
2013-12-11 00:03:04	@PikFan	yeah
2013-12-11 00:03:17	@PikFan	I think I saw one on sublevel 3 of the GK
2013-12-11 00:03:25	Espyo	because the name of that cave is easily recognizable: vs_3_toy
2013-12-11 00:03:31	Espyo	but the thing is...
2013-12-11 00:03:42	Espyo	I opened up Pikmin 2, ran the Carpet Room for a few times
2013-12-11 00:03:44	Espyo	and never saw that piece
2013-12-11 00:03:50	Espyo	I never even saw any 3-way crossings
2013-12-11 00:04:09	@PikFan	...there weren't any 3 way crossings?
2013-12-11 00:04:12	@PikFan	I
2013-12-11 00:04:18	@PikFan	gah enter key
2013-12-11 00:04:33	@PikFan	*I'm pretty sure that you start out in a 3-way crossing sometimes
2013-12-11 00:04:45	Espyo	hm
2013-12-11 00:04:51	Espyo	well, I'll check GK as well
2013-12-11 00:04:52	Espyo	thanks
2013-12-11 00:04:54	@PikFan	okay, what about the other one?
2013-12-11 00:04:55	Espyo	anyway, the second one
2013-12-11 00:05:09	Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/way4_kusachi.jpg also a 4-way crossing, this time on garden levels
2013-12-11 00:05:23	Espyo	I don't remember ever seeing a small stick standing up-right with a leaf casting a shadow
2013-12-11 00:05:40	@PikFan	hm
2013-12-11 00:05:49	@PikFan	I don't remember that
2013-12-11 00:06:11	@PikFan	do you have another picture of it?
2013-12-11 00:06:29	Espyo	sure
2013-12-11 00:07:14	Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/bmdview2%202013-12-11%2000-07-00-86.png
2013-12-11 00:07:52	@PikFan	yep, never seen that on
2013-12-11 00:07:53	@PikFan	*one
2013-12-11 00:09:33	Espyo	it's referenced in 14 configurations
2013-12-11 00:09:55	Espyo	the Brawl Yard being one of them... hmm
2013-12-11 00:11:05	@PikFan	I'll go boot it up, maybe I've never noticed it
2013-12-11 00:12:07	Espyo	mhm
2013-12-11 00:14:01	Espyo	kjahsdhkasd
2013-12-11 00:14:09	Espyo	I'm talking to someone on Skype who played the latest Pikmin 3 DLC
2013-12-11 00:14:26	Espyo	he says that if Louie (he's playable on one of the levels) is left somewhere idle, and he gets hurt
2013-12-11 00:14:43	Espyo	it says "This is Louis... Waaa!"
2013-12-11 00:14:46	Espyo	LOUIS
2013-12-11 00:19:51	@PikFan	BACK
2013-12-11 00:19:54	@PikFan	*back
2013-12-11 00:20:01	@PikFan	lolwhaaaat?
2013-12-11 00:20:30	@PikFan	anyway, I tested the Brawl Yard like 6 times
2013-12-11 00:20:36	@PikFan	didn't find the 4-way

2013-12-11 18:58:30	@J	my oven broke, so I started having sandwiches
2013-12-11 18:59:16	@J	now, sitting in front of me is a tuna mayonnaise sandwich with sweetcorn, smoked sausage, onion, pepper and tomato
2013-12-11 18:59:35	@J	and the bread is about as thick as my arm
2013-12-11 19:02:20	Espyo	not really the kind of sandwich I'm used to
2013-12-11 19:02:26	Espyo	by I I mean everybody
2013-12-11 19:02:37	Espyo	you can still cook rice and the like on a microwave
2013-12-11 19:05:29	@J	oh, the hob still works
2013-12-11 19:05:33	@J	just not the oveny bit
2013-12-11 19:05:50	@J	and I switch to sandwiches every so often anyway, just because
2013-12-11 19:06:27	Prezintenden	been living for 20 years
2013-12-11 19:06:48	Prezintenden	and not until today did i know what the hot plate thingies on top of an oven are called
2013-12-11 19:07:35	Espyo	what in the world is a hob
2013-12-11 19:07:41	Espyo	when in the world did Prez join
2013-12-11 19:07:41	Espyo	what is life
2013-12-11 19:07:42	Espyo	also hi
2013-12-11 19:08:01	Prezintenden	a hob is the hot plate thingy on the top of an oven
2013-12-11 19:08:04	Espyo	I eat sandwiches once a week anyway
2013-12-11 19:08:05	Prezintenden	hi
2013-12-11 19:08:10	Espyo	OH, that's what that is
2013-12-11 19:08:12	Espyo	noted
2013-12-11 19:10:04	@J	it's probably called something different in the US?
2013-12-11 19:10:36	Prezintenden	probably just 'stove'
2013-12-11 19:11:33	Prezintenden	so i saw miles is going to be at agdq. i was already excited but now i just can't wait
2013-12-11 19:11:59	Espyo	mhm
2013-12-11 19:12:10	Espyo	also I keep thinking Prez is from Germany
2013-12-11 19:12:14	Espyo	somebody shoot me already, eesh
2013-12-11 19:12:14	@J	some parts of the north of England call the whole thing a 'cooker', not sure if that's used elsewhere too
2013-12-11 19:12:20	@J	...he is
2013-12-11 19:12:21	Prezintenden	that's because i am
2013-12-11 19:12:26	Espyo	then why did
2013-12-11 19:12:28	Espyo	you mention the US
2013-12-11 19:12:35	@J	because they don't speak English in Germany?
2013-12-11 19:12:44	Espyo	err
2013-12-11 19:12:45	Espyo	fair point
2013-12-11 19:12:46	@J	US is just the default 'other English', I guess
2013-12-11 19:12:51	Espyo	ok, somebody really shoot me, good grief
2013-12-11 19:12:56	Espyo	yeah, I get that
2013-12-11 19:13:01	Espyo	good ol' neglected AU though
2013-12-11 19:13:10	Prezintenden	because i spent some time in canada, and pretty much everything english related is always from US. shows, movies, pop culture, britain has very little of that here
2013-12-11 19:13:21	@J	Miles was at the last few as well
2013-12-11 19:13:38	@J	in Canada or in Germany?
2013-12-11 19:13:43	Espyo	not the last one, I believe
2013-12-11 19:14:06	Prezintenden	really? i only watched bits and pieces of it, i didn't even know what it was until i happened upon the last one
2013-12-11 19:14:35	Prezintenden	germany. canada obviously is even less britain-y
2013-12-11 19:17:15	Miles	These two entirely different conversations are confusing me
2013-12-11 19:17:24	Miles	I've been to one of them
2013-12-11 19:17:34	Espyo	one of either Germany or Canada?

2013-12-11 20:13:09	Espyo	yeah, cellphones with letters on the number keys
2013-12-11 20:13:12	Espyo	those are still around
2013-12-11 20:13:27	@J	around, yes, but you say everyone
2013-12-11 20:13:41	Espyo	statistically everyone does
2013-12-11 20:13:48	@J	I see
2013-12-11 20:14:30	Espyo	say, gonna need your opinion/help for a bit
2013-12-11 20:14:46	Espyo	the way I'm thinking of making enemies on the Pikmin fangame engine is kinda like this:
2013-12-11 20:14:50	Espyo	an enemy is in a state
2013-12-11 20:15:05	Espyo	this can either be the chomping state,, the idling state, the walking state, etc.
2013-12-11 20:15:20	Espyo	(oh, so I did write a comma there already, my cursor was in the way)
2013-12-11 20:15:35	Espyo	on a text file (for now), you specify what each state is, and what happens in it
2013-12-11 20:15:58	Espyo	for instance, on the idling state of a Dwarf Bulborb, you specify that it enters the "sniffing the air animation" for a few seconds
2013-12-11 20:16:08	Espyo	and then randomly walks around and goes back to sniffing
2013-12-11 20:16:23	Espyo	then comes the state where it spots a Pikmin, so it changes to the walking animation, etc.
2013-12-11 20:16:37	Espyo	I made a text file with that info, I need your opinion on how much sense it makes
2013-12-11 20:17:05	Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/States.txt
2013-12-11 20:23:47	@J	specifying name like that makes it seem like it has no real significance
2013-12-11 20:23:59	@J	I would do 'idling{ ... }', etc.
2013-12-11 20:24:57	@J	specifying the script like that is weird
2013-12-11 20:25:11	Espyo	hm
2013-12-11 20:25:14	Espyo	I can actually do that
2013-12-11 20:25:16	Espyo	oh wait, I can't
2013-12-11 20:25:16	@J	it has the same format as other configuration sections, but works entirely differently
2013-12-11 20:25:20	@J	for one thing, it's ordered
2013-12-11 20:25:25	Espyo	near the end of the Wollywog info there's a condition
2013-12-11 20:25:30	Espyo	I gotta differentiate conditions from states
2013-12-11 20:25:33	@J	also, keys can be duplicated
2013-12-11 20:25:37	Espyo	they can
2013-12-11 20:25:45	@J	and writing them as assignments just looks wrong
2013-12-11 20:25:47	Espyo	I made the system so that keys can be duplicated
2013-12-11 20:25:50	Espyo	it sure does
2013-12-11 20:25:57	Espyo	I will in no way try to deny it
2013-12-11 20:26:01	Espyo	so why'd I do it?
2013-12-11 20:26:05	Espyo	consistency's sake
2013-12-11 20:26:08	Espyo	everything else uses this format
2013-12-11 20:26:22	Espyo	bleh, I'm pretty sure I'll skip making enemy scripts like this though
2013-12-11 20:26:27	Espyo	or a combination of sorts
2013-12-11 20:27:01	Espyo	http://mibpaste.com/d6fTTS kinda like that
2013-12-11 20:27:07	Espyo	though I guess key = value also works
2013-12-11 20:27:13	Espyo	I mean, I can understand what the script is meant to do
2013-12-11 20:30:57	@J	yes, of course I understand why you did it like that
2013-12-11 20:31:17	@J	it's not clear what happens when a state doesn't exist
2013-12-11 20:31:25	Espyo	hm
2013-12-11 20:31:31	Espyo	you mean like a death state that hasn't been defined?
2013-12-11 20:31:34	Espyo	obviously all enemies need that
2013-12-11 20:31:54	@J	like, MAL has no near_target
2013-12-11 20:32:08	Espyo	MAL is incomplete
2013-12-11 20:32:24	Espyo	it's just an excerpt for me to remind myself on how projectile spawn should probably work
2013-12-11 20:32:36	Espyo	hmm, but I get what you mean
2013-12-11 20:32:45	Espyo	I'll have to think a bit more about that part
2013-12-11 20:32:50	Espyo	though MAL is kind of a weird case
2013-12-11 20:32:58	Espyo	you could say his near_target is when there's a Pikmin within shooting range
2013-12-11 20:33:31	@J	hmm, I think it might be useful to use a different format to names of things that exist in the instance of the state
2013-12-11 20:33:35	@J	like target
2013-12-11 20:33:49	@J	for example, the projectile lines
2013-12-11 20:33:53	@J	bullet will always be bullet
2013-12-11 20:33:58	@J	target is a sort of argument to the script
2013-12-11 20:34:07	@J	maybe use caps
2013-12-11 20:35:09	Espyo	bullet won't always be bullet, could be a rock (Armored Cannon Beetle)
2013-12-11 20:35:20	Espyo	"target" is context-sensitive, I suppose
2013-12-11 20:35:24	@J	but for this script it will always be a bullet
2013-12-11 20:35:33	Espyo	the script doesn't know that though
2013-12-11 20:35:46	@J	by writing 'bullet', yes, it does
2013-12-11 20:36:01	Espyo	 20:33	J	bullet will always be bullet
2013-12-11 20:36:12	Espyo	by this I got the idea that "bullet" should be omitted
2013-12-11 20:36:38	Espyo	I'm not entirely following
2013-12-11 20:36:54	@J	no, I mean
2013-12-11 20:37:03	@J	write 'projectile = bullet TARGET 500'
2013-12-11 20:37:35	Espyo	hm
2013-12-11 20:37:46	Espyo	starting to deviate too much from my idea of user-friendliness
2013-12-11 20:37:54	@J	I think that makes it clearer
2013-12-11 20:38:06	Espyo	see that "-3 to 3"? it was meant to be "-3:3" or something of the sorts
2013-12-11 20:38:12	Espyo	it does a tiny bit, but
2013-12-11 20:38:21	Espyo	maybe I could just make it case insensitive
2013-12-11 20:38:35	@J	mm, doesn't really help
2013-12-11 20:38:44	Espyo	if the scripter wants to write in all caps, they can
2013-12-11 20:38:54	Espyo	but I know what you mean
2013-12-11 20:38:58	Espyo	words that are meant to be keywords
2013-12-11 20:39:08	Espyo	I don't really see that style anywhere else, though
2013-12-11 20:39:15	Espyo	except maybe SQL?
2013-12-11 20:39:43	@J	what's also unclear is which states can interrupt which other states
2013-12-11 20:39:52	@J	and, in some cases, when a state ends
2013-12-11 20:40:14	Espyo	right, I feared that
2013-12-11 20:40:19	Espyo	ok, so my idea is
2013-12-11 20:40:31	Espyo	the script goes from start to finish, stopping whenever there's a wait
2013-12-11 20:40:51	Espyo	while a state's script is running, another state cannot be entered
2013-12-11 20:40:56	Espyo	except important states, like dying
2013-12-11 20:41:11	Espyo	for instance, a Dwarf will never chase a Pikmin, turn, or do anything if it's lying down because it failed a bite
2013-12-11 20:41:13	Espyo	but it will always die
2013-12-11 20:41:23	Espyo	also anything can interrupt its random idling
2013-12-11 20:41:32	Espyo	be it being attacked, squashed, a Pikmin nearing up, etc.
2013-12-11 20:41:38	Espyo	the names I chose were really poor, though
2013-12-11 20:41:49	@J	if seeing_target happens, when does it stop?
2013-12-11 20:41:57	@J	when it reaches the target?  What if the target moves?
2013-12-11 20:42:08	Espyo	hmm
2013-12-11 20:42:09	@J	does near_target happen?
2013-12-11 20:42:41	Espyo	after turning towards the target (and waiting until the turn is complete, I should've added that)
2013-12-11 20:42:44	@J	when you say 'walk = target', does that put it in the 'walknig' state?
2013-12-11 20:42:52	Espyo	and after setting the sights on the target and walking towards it
2013-12-11 20:42:55	Espyo	the state's script ends
2013-12-11 20:43:00	@J	if so, why the 'animation = walking'?
2013-12-11 20:43:01	Espyo	and any state can take over from here on
2013-12-11 20:43:12	Espyo	hmm
2013-12-11 20:43:24	Espyo	yeah, walk = target puts it in the walking state
2013-12-11 20:43:32	Espyo	and yeah, the animation declaration is unneeded
2013-12-11 20:43:39	Espyo	guh, but then it can't go back to the previous state
2013-12-11 20:43:46	Espyo	see, it's all so confusing, that's why I needed a second opinion
2013-12-11 20:44:40	@J	okay, I would say make idling not a state
2013-12-11 20:44:49	@J	instead, define idling actions separately
2013-12-11 20:45:28	@J	then, whenever a script does 'state = <state>', end the script and jump straight to that state
2013-12-11 20:45:40	@J	when a script ends without setting a state, go back to idling
2013-12-11 20:46:10	Espyo	hm
2013-12-11 20:46:23	Espyo	then what about the "chasing target" state?
2013-12-11 20:46:31	Espyo	I suppose it is ran until the target is caught
2013-12-11 20:46:40	Espyo	but I wanted to make a system where all states are independent
2013-12-11 20:46:49	Espyo	and this makes the catching state dependent of the chasing one
2013-12-11 20:47:12	Espyo	did you ever do anything of this sort before?
2013-12-11 20:47:46	@J	I don't see a 'chasing target' state
2013-12-11 20:49:36	@J	or make state switching more detailed
2013-12-11 20:50:13	@J	in a script: 'state{  name = walking  target = TARGET  }'
2013-12-11 20:50:25	Espyo	oh, I guess a chasing_target state would make it slightly less confusing
2013-12-11 20:50:36	@J	maybe you can specify, in there, chase = true
2013-12-11 20:50:53	@J	if false, target becomes fixed at call time
2013-12-11 20:51:16	Espyo	I'm not seeing it at all
2013-12-11 20:51:28	Espyo	hm
2013-12-11 20:51:34	Espyo	or rather, it seems something super-specific to walking
2013-12-11 20:51:43	Espyo	doesn't really bring out the notion of all states being independent
2013-12-11 20:55:51	Espyo	I have to reimagine the whole thing
2013-12-11 20:55:56	@J	I think one issue is that walking is a state, but all the rest are events
2013-12-11 20:55:57	Espyo	basing myself on how Doom works isn't helping
2013-12-11 20:56:15	Espyo	yes, I'm starting to get the idea that these are half states, half events
2013-12-11 20:56:34	Espyo	in fact, I think that's where the biggest flaw is
2013-12-11 21:03:37	-->	BetaMaster (BetaMaster@c-521-44-23-901.hsd6.pa.comcast.net) has joined #pikipedia
2013-12-11 21:06:57	@J	I think there's just too much to care about
2013-12-11 21:07:20	@J	like, the shooting thing: how do you know the target's in range?
2013-12-11 21:07:43	Espyo	it's defined on the enemy's info
2013-12-11 21:07:48	Espyo	like we have on Pikmin 2
2013-12-11 21:07:52	Espyo	enemy see range
2013-12-11 21:08:01	@J	in range to hit, I mean
2013-12-11 21:08:10	@J	maybe shooting range != sight range
2013-12-11 21:08:31	@J	and does it stop when the enemy's out of range?
2013-12-11 21:08:45	@J	everything is going to be so confusing
2013-12-11 21:08:45	Espyo	that could be defined as well
2013-12-11 21:08:51	Espyo	it sure is
2013-12-11 21:09:02	Espyo	programming enemy by enemy would be easier than this
2013-12-11 21:09:46	Espyo	but I might be able to improve this mess by splitting events and states
2013-12-11 21:10:36	@J	I tried writing some stuff, and just couldn't work out what I was supposed to do and what would be done for me
2013-12-11 21:10:57	@J	I mean, how do I handle moving targets?
2013-12-11 21:11:13	@J	does the enemy just try to do what he's trying to do until he gets stuck?
2013-12-11 21:11:38	@J	do scripts get continual updates about the environment in any way?
2013-12-11 21:12:10	@J	if I'm chasing a Pikmin and another attacks from behind, how do I start chasing that one?
2013-12-11 21:12:14	Espyo	I suppose that turning and walking is asynchronous
2013-12-11 21:12:21	Espyo	keeps going and it won't stop until the target is faced
2013-12-11 21:12:27	Espyo	if the target keeps moving, it still keeps going
2013-12-11 21:12:31	Espyo	(faced or reached)
2013-12-11 21:12:47	Espyo	there's no notion of getting stuck, btw
2013-12-11 21:12:57	Espyo	seriously, the enemies in the original Pikmin games are idiotic
2013-12-11 21:13:17	Espyo	it's thanks to a Bulbear getting stuck on a wall chasing a single Pikmin that I can go through the Hole of Heroes without fighting
2013-12-11 21:13:40	Espyo	I think they also don't switch targets
2013-12-11 21:13:57	Espyo	unless the target they have on their sights is gone or too far away, they'll keep focusing on it
2013-12-11 21:14:09	Espyo	again, the whole Bulbear getting stuck on a wall focused on a single Pikmin

2013-12-12 20:25:02	@J	what does that even
2013-12-12 20:25:02	Testyo	Oh, J, you have a memo from Espyo, written on 12/12/2013 11:16 (GMT), saying: http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=User:Optimopro&rcid=30804.

2013-12-12 20:27:29	Espyo	I have no idea
2013-12-12 21:11:04	Espyo	why was wondering why I didn't have room_pool5x5_5_tile.jpg on the folder
2013-12-12 21:11:12	Espyo	then I realized I named it room_poo5x5_5_tile.jpg

2013-12-12 21:39:26	@PikFan	I know why White and Purple Pikmin don't have Onions

2013-12-12 21:41:50	@PikFan	at 2:20
2013-12-12 21:45:44	@J	I don't see how that explains it
2013-12-12 21:46:10	@PikFan	Brittany states that Onions need light to live
2013-12-12 21:46:23	@PikFan	Purples/Whites are a subterranean species of Pikmin
2013-12-12 21:46:33	@PikFan	and since they live underground, there's no light
2013-12-12 21:46:58	@PikFan	which explains the absence of their Onions
2013-12-12 21:58:35	@J	in what way do they live underground?
2013-12-12 21:58:51	@J	purple/white candypops are underground, but so are red, blue and yellow
2013-12-12 21:59:16	@J	you saying the fact they're only underground explains that they're only underground

2013-12-12 22:03:32	@PikFan	I said I know why they don't have Onions, not why they're underground

2013-12-12 22:11:46	Espyo	hey
2013-12-12 22:11:59	@PikFan	hi
2013-12-12 22:12:10	Espyo	hmm, gotta agree with J
2013-12-12 22:12:16	Espyo	it's only their buds that are underground
2013-12-12 22:13:09	@PikFan	but that's implying that their Onions could be aboveground
2013-12-12 22:13:33	@PikFan	(I finally realized what J meant)
2013-12-12 22:16:57	@PikFan	strictly speaking, in Pikmin 2 alone, there are no purple/white Onions aboveground
2013-12-12 22:20:29	Espyo	yeah
2013-12-12 22:21:43	Espyo	oh notch
2013-12-12 22:21:49	Espyo	is there anything you don't donate to?
2013-12-12 22:21:57	Espyo	I detest your coding skills
2013-12-12 22:22:03	Espyo	and I think you're a lazy bum
2013-12-12 22:22:10	Espyo	but you're nice by donating your millions

2013-12-12 22:22:33	@PikFan	oh
2013-12-12 22:22:42	@PikFan	oh, I see
2013-12-12 22:22:43	@PikFan	heh
2013-12-12 22:24:09	Espyo	Pikmin 2 is so unorganized that it's hard to find out exactly what cave types there are by looking at the files
2013-12-12 22:24:46	Espyo	but I think I concluded: brick, concrete, dirt, garden, metal, snow, swamp, toybox and tiles
2013-12-12 22:25:53	Espyo	there's all_units_conc, all_units_hitode_toy, all_units_kusachi, all_units_metal, all_units_renga, all_units_snow, all_units_tile, all_units_toy, all_units_tsuchi, all_units_water_tsuchi, all_units_water-ike4
2013-12-12 22:26:13	Espyo	conc is concrete, hitode toy contains the same cave pieces as toy, but less
2013-12-12 22:26:19	Espyo	kusachi is garden, renga is brick
2013-12-12 22:26:24	Espyo	tsuchi is supposedly dirt
2013-12-12 22:26:37	Espyo	I suppose "water" could also be another type, for water_tsuchi
2013-12-12 22:26:49	Espyo	water-ike4 uses the swamp-like pieces
2013-12-12 22:26:53	Espyo	thoughts?
2013-12-12 22:27:16	@PikFan	you could ask the developers
2013-12-12 22:27:29	Espyo	yeah
2013-12-12 22:27:36	Espyo	too bad they would only reply in 2050

2013-12-12 23:39:33	@PikFan	the guy just got a data file, which says: "Yellow Pikmin are good at digging."

2013-12-13 20:42:27	Espyo	oh, you said 3
2013-12-13 20:42:32	Espyo	scratch no violence then
2013-12-13 20:43:25	@J	git repository
2013-12-13 20:43:42	@J	no enemies and no violence are boring and describe most games
2013-12-13 20:43:50	@J	the others are correct
2013-12-13 20:43:54	Espyo	most games that happen to have the theme
2013-12-13 20:44:00	Espyo	not most games that have the theme on purpose
2013-12-13 20:44:16	@J	I mean, they don't restrict you very much
2013-12-13 20:44:16	Espyo	in that case, Break the System
2013-12-13 20:44:23	@J	yes
2013-12-13 20:44:23	Espyo	they do
2013-12-13 20:44:27	Espyo	if you do like Tetris
2013-12-13 20:44:29	Espyo	that follows the theme
2013-12-13 20:44:36	Espyo	but you can do, like...
2013-12-13 20:44:40	Espyo	uhm
2013-12-13 20:44:46	Espyo	well, I'll think of something, maybe
2013-12-13 20:44:49	@J	I think I've created about 2 games that don't follow those
2013-12-13 20:45:07	Espyo	that don't follow No Violence and No Enemies?
2013-12-13 20:45:10	@J	yeah
2013-12-13 20:45:12	Espyo	so... a violent enemy game
2013-12-13 20:45:30	@J	no, that don't follow at least one of them
2013-12-13 20:45:35	Espyo	oh
2013-12-13 20:45:40	@J	and here 'violence' = 'physics'
2013-12-13 20:45:41	@J	...
2013-12-13 20:46:16	@J	anyway, there are obviously always alternative interpretations - like, maybe no enemies means you want a fight but no-one will fight you because they all love you, so you have to make people hate you
2013-12-13 20:46:29	Espyo	yeah
2013-12-13 20:46:34	Espyo	that's what I meant
2013-12-13 20:46:35	@J	but I still prefer most of the others
2013-12-13 20:46:40	Espyo	so those themes aren't that bad
2013-12-13 20:46:41	Espyo	agreed, though
2013-12-13 20:46:50	Espyo	specially Death is Useful
2013-12-13 20:46:54	Espyo	but I can see what's going to happen already
2013-12-13 20:46:58	@J	have you ever played 'Puzzle Game' by increpare?
2013-12-13 20:47:10	@J	uh, sorry, 'Puzzles'
2013-12-13 20:47:11	Espyo	you die, you leave a corpse, the corpse can be used as a platform
2013-12-13 20:47:14	Espyo	cue 1500 games like that
2013-12-13 20:47:19	Espyo	don't recall, don't think I did
2013-12-13 20:47:28	@J	hmm, I made a game kind of like that, if you recall
2013-12-13 20:47:32	Espyo	you did
2013-12-13 20:47:44	Espyo	but that wasn't following a Death is Useful theme, was it?
2013-12-13 20:47:46	@J	anyway, Puzzles is both very good and matches the death theme very well
2013-12-13 20:47:56	@J	no, it wasn't
2013-12-13 20:48:22	@J	the theme was 'alone'
2013-12-13 20:48:29	Espyo	right
2013-12-13 20:48:32	Espyo	say, random thought
2013-12-13 20:48:39	Espyo	nobody's gonna bother to check every game's source code carefully
2013-12-13 20:48:47	Espyo	what would it take for somebody to just stick a virus on a game?
2013-12-13 20:48:55	Espyo	now I don't wanna judge games anymore
2013-12-13 20:50:16	@J	I think it would be picked up pretty quickly
2013-12-13 20:50:25	@J	but yeah, it would probably affect at least one person
2013-12-13 20:50:29	Espyo	after a couple of people have been infected alerady
2013-12-13 20:50:31	Espyo	*already
2013-12-13 20:50:34	Espyo	mhm
2013-12-13 20:50:44	Espyo	sure, I doubt that would happen, but
2013-12-13 20:50:53	Espyo	what if someone goes too meta on the Break the System theme?
2013-12-13 23:00:10	@J	okay, time to get some sleep
2013-12-13 23:00:27	@J	I'll probably wake up fairly early to find out the theme, then think of ideas while I do stuff
2013-12-13 23:00:33	@J	might be here at that point
2013-12-13 23:01:08	@J	then when I have an idea, probably 9am-ish, I'm going to the meetup thing
2013-12-13 23:01:12	Espyo	ditto
2013-12-13 23:01:20	Espyo	I'll wake up at 10 AM though
2013-12-13 23:01:23	@J	heh
2013-12-13 23:01:29	@J	what if you went to sleep now?
2013-12-13 23:01:39	@J	or did you mean 10am is early?
2013-12-13 23:01:40	Espyo	if I wake up on a single-digit hour, I'm dead
2013-12-13 23:01:51	Espyo	 10 AM is early for a guy who normally wakes up at noon
2013-12-13 23:01:53	Espyo	i.e. me
2013-12-13 23:01:57	@J	just change your clocks?
2013-12-13 23:02:04	Espyo	ok, that's not true any more, I wake up at 11AM now
2013-12-13 23:02:07	Espyo	hmm
2013-12-13 23:02:08	Espyo	good idea
2013-12-13 23:02:17	Espyo	I'll wake up at 8, but my clock will mark noon
2013-12-13 23:02:33	Espyo	then I'll feel relaxed even though I slept 9 hours
2013-12-13 23:02:42	@J	9 hours = plety
2013-12-13 23:02:44	@J	*plenty
2013-12-13 23:02:55	Espyo	I hate undersleeping, but truth be told, it is kinda plenty

2013-12-13 23:03:48	@J	it is if you wake up at 11

2013-12-14 19:47:19	Espyo	heh, Testyo might be able to calculate 0 K
2013-12-14 19:47:19	Testyo	0 K = -273.15 °C / -4884.7 °F
2013-12-14 19:47:24	Espyo	but that's nothing
2013-12-14 19:47:29	Espyo	he can do negative stones: -50st
2013-12-14 19:47:29	Testyo	-50 st = -317.515 kg / -700 lb / -11200 oz
2013-12-14 19:51:53	@J	so how's it going?
2013-12-14 19:52:01	Espyo	pretty fine, actually
2013-12-14 19:52:10	Espyo	though I'm starting to think I undershot it
2013-12-14 19:52:21	Espyo	I think I might have too much time for the simplifications I'm making
2013-12-14 19:52:28	Espyo	though on the other hand, I know I can't be overconfident
2013-12-14 19:52:32	Espyo	what about you?
2013-12-14 19:53:51	@J	there's always time for more polish
2013-12-14 19:53:59	Espyo	yeah, there is
2013-12-14 19:54:00	@J	it's going okay
2013-12-14 19:54:07	@J	still not sure how it'll turn out - whether it'll be fun
2013-12-14 19:54:08	Espyo	I know I'll have time tomorrow to make it all detailed
2013-12-14 19:54:11	Espyo	but I meant the overall idea
2013-12-14 19:54:17	Espyo	I've got a bit of the same problem
2013-12-14 19:54:26	@J	I have all the gameplay, but the only arena is boring and there's no graphics and sounds
2013-12-14 19:54:29	Espyo	it's a puzzle game, so I guess I can always rely on puzzle elements being there
2013-12-14 19:54:40	Espyo	but is your gameplay going?
2013-12-14 19:54:51	Espyo	oh, that was literally the start of the message
2013-12-14 19:54:54	Espyo	that's odd, I missed it
2013-12-14 20:03:31	@J	I'll elaborate after food
2013-12-14 20:03:42	Espyo	mhm
2013-12-14 20:35:15	@J	so someone I know is still deciding which compiler to use
2013-12-14 20:35:27	Espyo	they haven't started yet?
2013-12-14 20:38:27	@J	[11:38:10] @Trubydoor basically, it cant deal with value initializing a struct with {} as a non
2013-12-14 20:38:27	@J	static data member of another struct
2013-12-14 20:38:27	@J	[11:38:12] @Trubydoor that just crashes the compiler
2013-12-14 20:38:27	@J	[11:38:25] @Trubydoor I sent in a bug report but they haven't responded
2013-12-14 20:38:27	@J	[11:41:09] @Trubydoor which is a bit naughty given that I have a legitimate copy of VS2013 Ultimate,and for all they know I paid for it
2013-12-14 20:39:11	Espyo	pfft
2013-12-14 20:39:21	Espyo	do they really think they can have anything working on a VS compiler?
2013-12-14 20:39:33	Espyo	not to mention bring a bug to microsoft's attention?
2013-12-14 20:39:34	Espyo	hah
2013-12-14 20:43:23	@J	okay, my idea
2013-12-14 20:43:37	Espyo	mhm, shoot
2013-12-14 20:43:44	@J	2-player battle
2013-12-14 20:43:48	@J	fight with mines
2013-12-14 20:43:58	Espyo	mines a la touch-sensitive mines?
2013-12-14 20:43:58	@J	you can use as many dummy mines as you want, but have only one real mine
2013-12-14 20:44:06	@J	no, remote detonation
2013-12-14 20:44:09	Espyo	ah
2013-12-14 20:44:13	Espyo	more like C4 then
2013-12-14 20:44:28	@J	except that one player's real mine is a dud
2013-12-14 20:44:35	@J	and neither player knows which
2013-12-14 20:44:40	Espyo	hmmmm
2013-12-14 20:44:50	Espyo	doesn't seem too fair for now, but go on
2013-12-14 20:44:55	@J	you also have a limited number of times to use a laser thing to destroy every mine
2013-12-14 20:45:02	@J	and that's it
2013-12-14 20:45:10	Espyo	hm, so let me see if I got it
2013-12-14 20:45:13	@J	so, as I say, no idea how well it'll work, but
2013-12-14 20:45:14	Espyo	you can blow up on your own mines?
2013-12-14 20:45:17	@J	yes
2013-12-14 20:45:19	Espyo	ah
2013-12-14 20:45:23	Espyo	ok, then that's fairer
2013-12-14 20:45:27	Espyo	seems kinda fun
2013-12-14 20:45:36	Espyo	but I think the best bet would be to make it as chaotic as possible
2013-12-14 20:45:43	Espyo	go for chaotic fun instead of strategic fun
2013-12-14 20:45:44	@J	if either player dies, the other wins
2013-12-14 20:45:45	Espyo	 /new terms
2013-12-14 20:45:56	@J	if neither player dies, the player without the mine wins
2013-12-14 20:46:04	Espyo	time out?
2013-12-14 20:46:16	@J	I don't see any reason to
2013-12-14 20:46:20	@J	matches shouldn't last long
2013-12-14 20:46:30	Espyo	right, but how can a match end with no deaths?
2013-12-14 20:46:40	@J	because only one player had a mine
2013-12-14 20:46:45	@J	so that player missed, so he lost
2013-12-14 20:46:59	Espyo	oh
2013-12-14 20:47:05	Espyo	right, when they detonate their real mine
2013-12-14 20:47:13	Espyo	fair enough
2013-12-14 20:47:28	Espyo	but still, making it more chaotic would probably be best
2013-12-14 20:47:35	Espyo	powerups could start deviating from the theme too much, though
2013-12-14 20:47:48	@J	I'm not sure if it would be better if both players had a working mine
2013-12-14 20:48:00	@J	yes, I thought about powerups, but only mobility powerups
2013-12-14 20:48:18	@J	speed, flight, slow down the other guy, throw mines really far, etc.
2013-12-14 20:48:39	Espyo	right
2013-12-14 20:48:55	Espyo	but unless you incorporate the theme into the powerups, I don't think they'd be a good idea
2013-12-14 20:49:01	Espyo	on that note, only having one real mine seems good too
2013-12-14 20:49:10	Espyo	and having two might make the game less original, IMO
2013-12-14 20:50:36	Espyo	ok, so mine is a puzzle game set in a cave
2013-12-14 20:50:56	Espyo	for every cave in your roadtrip, you get to take only one of each type of tool
2013-12-14 20:51:02	Espyo	or only certain types of tools, I'm still not sure
2013-12-14 20:51:17	Espyo	these include ziplines, grapple hooks, etc.
2013-12-14 20:51:32	Espyo	your job is to go on each cave and collect a jewel, then return
2013-12-14 20:51:42	Espyo	however the caves have a long spell that punish greed
2013-12-14 20:51:56	Espyo	they reward those brave enough to venture through with a jewel
2013-12-14 20:52:05	Espyo	but if they so much as touch another one, the cave crumbles on them
2013-12-14 20:52:22	Espyo	so not only do you only have one tool of each (or something of the sort), you can also only have one jewel
2013-12-14 20:52:37	Espyo	the puzzle will come from picking the right tools, the right spots to use them, and the paths to take
2013-12-14 20:52:49	Espyo	a bit like Spelunky meets Lemmings
2013-12-14 20:54:56	@J	[20:48:55] Espyo but unless you incorporate the theme into the powerups, I don't think they'd be a
2013-12-14 20:54:56	@J	good idea
2013-12-14 20:55:00	@J	nah, there'd be no problem
2013-12-14 20:55:18	@J	[20:49:10] Espyo and having two might make the game less original, IMO
2013-12-14 20:55:20	Espyo	I mean that the theme wouldn't be felt as much
2013-12-14 20:55:25	@J	it's the dummies that make it original, I think
2013-12-14 20:55:43	Espyo	dunno, I'm really fond of that "only one of you having a real one but neither one knowing" thing
2013-12-14 20:56:20	@J	not sure how Lemmings comes into it
2013-12-14 20:56:39	@J	mm, yeah, I do just want to see what happens
2013-12-14 20:57:07	@J	there is an issue, though: it's pretty hard to play with 2 players using the keyboard
2013-12-14 20:57:30	Espyo	heh, only in how you have to pick what tools to use and where
2013-12-14 20:57:46	Espyo	I mostly say Lemmings because I checked Lemmings 2's list of abilities and took out a few
2013-12-14 20:57:58	Espyo	platform, cannon, shovel, pickaxe ,...
2013-12-14 20:58:08	Espyo	hm
2013-12-14 20:58:11	Espyo	what are your controls?
2013-12-14 20:58:18	Espyo	uh... you may wanna answer in key positions
2013-12-14 20:58:20	Espyo	not key names
2013-12-14 20:58:41	@J	wasd/arrow keys
2013-12-14 20:58:52	Espyo	for player 1/2?
2013-12-14 20:58:58	@J	then each player needs 4 extra buttons
2013-12-14 20:59:00	@J	yes
2013-12-14 20:59:02	Espyo	four?
2013-12-14 20:59:12	@J	throw dummy mine, throw real mine, detonate mines, use lasers
2013-12-14 20:59:25	Espyo	hm, right
2013-12-14 20:59:41	@J	on a controller, I'm using left analogue, 4 buttons (one to jump) and a trigger
2013-12-14 20:59:45	@J	and that works fine
2013-12-14 21:00:11	Espyo	I guess making the controls configurable would be your bes tbet
2013-12-14 21:00:12	Espyo	*best bet
2013-12-14 21:00:21	@J	not easy in the time limit
2013-12-14 21:00:40	@J	though making it easy is on the game engine's todo list
2013-12-14 21:00:40	Espyo	it's not that hard to load files in C++
2013-12-14 21:00:47	Espyo	which automatically means it's ultra easy to do it in Python
2013-12-14 21:00:48	Espyo	so...
2013-12-14 21:00:49	@J	oh, you mean by editing a file?
2013-12-14 21:00:52	Espyo	yeah
2013-12-14 21:00:55	Espyo	no menus or anything
2013-12-14 21:00:57	@J	meh, no-one would do that
2013-12-14 21:01:10	@J	if they would, it's already a file
2013-12-14 21:01:11	Espyo	how so?
2013-12-14 21:01:17	Espyo	uh, not following
2013-12-14 21:01:23	@J	because it's a Ludum Dare game
2013-12-14 21:01:51	@J	but yeah, it is configurable already, in a sense
2013-12-14 21:02:22	@J	http://sprunge.us/aPPT
2013-12-14 21:02:36	@J	no 2nd player gamepad support yet
2013-12-14 21:02:37	Espyo	oh, you're using your engine?
2013-12-14 21:02:41	@J	yes
2013-12-14 21:02:44	Espyo	oh
2013-12-14 21:02:51	Espyo	that changes what I was thinking then
2013-12-14 21:03:03	@J	I've used it for the last few games I've made
2013-12-14 21:03:21	Espyo	Wearhouse was one of them, I think
2013-12-14 21:03:24	@J	at least partially to find bugs/areas for improvement
2013-12-14 21:03:33	@J	not initially, but I recently-ish rewrote it to use it
2013-12-14 21:05:28	@J	I already have a sizeable list of game engine changes from today

2013-12-14 21:56:32	@J	[21:13:52] Espyo you plan on using sfxr?
2013-12-14 21:56:44	@J	yeah, though it'd be nice to get a microphone some day
2013-12-14 21:56:54	@J	a decent one, I mean
2013-12-14 21:57:00	@J	that isn't attached to a huge laptop
2013-12-14 21:57:06	Espyo	right
2013-12-14 21:57:12	Espyo	but what do you plan on recording with it?
2013-12-14 21:57:18	@J	sound effects
2013-12-14 21:57:21	@J	?
2013-12-14 21:57:23	Espyo	right, but from your mouth?
2013-12-14 21:57:28	@J	oh
2013-12-14 21:57:41	@J	well, it depends
2013-12-14 21:58:00	@J	for example, Wearhouse, I recorded the changing clothes sound by ruffling some bed sheets
2013-12-14 21:58:07	@J	*in Wearhous
2013-12-14 21:58:07	@J	e
2013-12-14 21:58:15	Espyo	neat
2013-12-14 21:58:22	Espyo	but isn't it too noisy over there, anyway?
2013-12-14 21:58:23	@J	knocks and steps and stuff would be fairly easy
2013-12-14 21:58:32	Espyo	or are you not planning on doing it for this game at all?
2013-12-14 21:58:44	@J	no, not for this game - like I said, no microphone
2013-12-14 21:59:09	Espyo	there's the laptop one
2013-12-14 21:59:11	@J	but I left the meetup around 7pm for food and because it would be too noisy to do any sound stuff
2013-12-14 21:59:16	@J	like I said, that's horrible
2013-12-14 21:59:25	Espyo	right, but you used it for Wearhouse
2013-12-14 21:59:36	@J	no, I used my brother' camera
2013-12-14 21:59:39	@J	*brother's
2013-12-14 21:59:41	Espyo	ah
2013-12-14 22:00:26	@J	I wouldn't worry so much if the sound were just low quality, but it's the noise that you get
2013-12-14 22:00:37	Espyo	right
2013-12-14 22:00:47	Espyo	though it can be kinda removed with Audacity
2013-12-14 22:01:07	Espyo	and you know what, it doesn't do a bad job at it
2013-12-14 22:01:11	@J	eh, not really
2013-12-14 22:01:15	@J	it gets kind of robotic
2013-12-14 22:01:18	Espyo	hm
2013-12-14 22:01:41	Espyo	well, you know how the Pikmin 2 OSTs that are always lying around always have an annoying buzzing?
2013-12-14 22:01:50	@J	they do?
2013-12-14 22:01:54	Espyo	it's most notable on Perplexing Pool sunset, IIRC
2013-12-14 22:02:14	Espyo	or Awakening Wood sunset, mostly when it gets quiet
2013-12-14 22:02:21	@J	yeah, I think I know what you mean
2013-12-14 22:02:26	Espyo	I used Audacity to remove it, and it worked wonderfully
2013-12-14 22:02:37	Espyo	never tried sound effects recorded from a mic though
2013-12-14 22:02:56	@J	I have, not with much success
2013-12-14 22:03:06	@J	I mean, it gets better, and I did use it with the camera
2013-12-14 22:03:17	@J	but not always good enough
2013-12-14 22:03:30	Espyo	hm, right
2013-12-14 22:04:21	@J	well, I could try
2013-12-14 22:04:40	@J	might annoy the neighbours...
2013-12-14 22:04:48	Espyo	heh
2013-12-14 22:04:58	Espyo	now, to simulate a mine explosion...
2013-12-14 22:05:14	Espyo	you probably want to precariously hang all your decorations, connected them all to the same string, and pull hard
2013-12-14 22:24:06	@J	well...I managed a laser
2013-12-14 22:24:20	@J	1/10 sounds done
2013-12-14 22:24:28	Espyo	heh
2013-12-14 22:25:08	@J	to generate a crumbling laser-ified mine sound, I could use sand, but it's not like I have any
2013-12-14 22:26:44	Espyo	yeah
2013-12-14 22:28:19	@J	this sort of stuff doesn't seem loud enough to pick up (I tried some gravy granules)

2013-12-14 23:03:23	@PikFan	hi
2013-12-14 23:03:29	@PikFan	sounds fun
2013-12-14 23:03:40	Espyo	it is

2013-12-14 23:08:17	@J	not entirely sure what I've done
2013-12-14 23:08:20	@J	but I don't like it
2013-12-14 23:10:37	Espyo	sounds sfxry
2013-12-14 23:10:47	Espyo	can't really say I find it that great either
2013-12-14 23:11:03	@J	everything's too short and not explosiony enough

2013-12-14 23:12:33	Espyo	well, that single noise made me think that the theme for the final boss battle in Sonic 2 was going to start
2013-12-14 23:12:41	Espyo	it sounds kinda the same, but the note is the exact same one
2013-12-14 23:12:49	Espyo	but it sounds lasery enough
2013-12-14 23:13:33	@J	I just make 2 saw waves with different frequencies, then a tiny fade out

2013-12-15 22:34:32	@PikFan	hah, they STILL don't have area layout descriptions for the Garden of Hope and the Tropical Wilds
2013-12-15 22:35:06	@PikFan	when I get Pikmin 3 and fully play through it I'll scan the whole map and describe the layout
2013-12-15 22:35:12	@PikFan	take that, wikia
2013-12-15 22:36:12	@PikFan	is it me or do people write way too much on wikia
2013-12-15 22:36:23	@PikFan	they make things too long, it seems
2013-12-15 22:41:37	@J	more like people write stuff, then others come and add stuff later, because adding is easier than rewriting
2013-12-15 22:41:56	@J	it's a problem on every wiki, but moreso on ones that aren't very well-curated
2013-12-15 22:42:07	@J	anyway, must continue to games

2013-12-15 22:49:54	Espyo	I'm just about to implement the particle system too
2013-12-15 22:51:42	@J	I actually need it because I can't be bothered to make actual graphics for some things
2013-12-15 22:51:45	@J	they can be just particles

2013-12-15 23:11:31	Espyo	might as well
2013-12-15 23:11:34	Espyo	for extra humor points
2013-12-15 23:11:38	Espyo	on the other hand, it's a pun
2013-12-15 23:11:40	Espyo	so negative points
2013-12-15 23:17:54	@J	so my game engine has a weird graphics bug where sometimes things take a while to get removed
2013-12-15 23:18:12	@J	removed from the screen, that is

2013-12-15 23:20:15	Espyo	well, can't say at all if it's the same thing, but...

2013-12-15 23:20:22	Espyo	the way I have animations set up is a set of frames, obviously
2013-12-15 23:20:25	Espyo	each frame has a duration
2013-12-15 23:20:37	Espyo	when an animation is ticked, the time remaining for the current frame goes down
2013-12-15 23:20:41	Espyo	if it reaches 0, next frame
2013-12-15 23:21:09	Espyo	though if the time removed from the tick is so much that the next frame should've already played and disappeared, it'll go to the next frame regardless
2013-12-15 23:21:20	Espyo	which'll exist for a single frame, until it realizes THEN that it shouldn't be on this frame
2013-12-15 23:21:27	Espyo	so maybe a bunch of those are causing delay?
2013-12-15 23:21:35	Espyo	if it's even remotely similar to what I said
2013-12-15 23:23:46	@J	spent 15 minutes trying to work out why the particles with an increasing area covered were moving down-right
2013-12-15 23:24:11	@J	assuming the whole time that a graphic's resize anchor default was its centre
2013-12-15 23:24:15	@J	but it's actually the top-left
2013-12-15 23:24:27	@J	so as it gets bigger, it's top-left stays where it is
2013-12-15 23:26:02	Espyo	hehe
2013-12-15 23:26:33	@J	I'll consider your animation suggestion once I'm closer to finishing
2013-12-15 23:36:21	@J	okay, because of integer rounding, the whole particle system vibrates
2013-12-15 23:36:28	@J	which actually looks good, because it's an explosion
2013-12-15 23:39:24	Espyo	heh
2013-12-15 23:39:31	Espyo	you going to leave it in?
2013-12-15 23:43:34	@J	yes
2013-12-15 23:43:39	@J	it's not like I could easily fix it
2013-12-15 23:43:41	Espyo	how deliciously hacky
2013-12-15 23:47:09	@J	the laziest thing: I show who won by fading the screen to their colour
2013-12-15 23:47:15	@J	black in a tie
2013-12-15 23:47:24	@J	*for a tie, I guess
2013-12-15 23:50:36	Espyo	hehe
2013-12-15 23:50:43	Espyo	no text at all in the game?
2013-12-15 23:57:10	@J	yes, but not for that
2013-12-15 23:57:15	@J	only for the intro screen
2013-12-15 23:57:25	@J	which is beautifully horrible
2013-12-15 23:58:04	Espyo	time for the intro screen myself
2013-12-15 23:58:10	Espyo	which will probably be beautifully horrible as well
2013-12-15 23:58:38	@J	okay, I discovered why one of the animations was hanging around on the last frame
2013-12-15 23:58:47	Espyo	oh?
2013-12-15 23:59:01	@J	I had set a timeout to call the function to remove it in 1s, and just above that was '# TODO: use animation callback'
2013-12-15 23:59:11	@J	you'll never guess how I fixed it
2013-12-15 23:59:44	Espyo	remove it in 0.999999s?
2013-12-16 00:01:14	@J	no, use the animation callback
2013-12-16 00:01:30	Espyo	aww, that's not hacky
2013-12-16 00:01:35	@J	hey, I thought I was being rhetorical
2013-12-16 00:02:02	Espyo	heh, you weren't
2013-12-16 00:02:03	@J	it's nice being able to copy/paste hex colours from GIMP straight into the code without modifying them
2013-12-16 00:02:36	Espyo	I don't use hex for colors on my code, but I do copy the hex between Paint.Net and Inkscape
2013-12-16 00:03:52	@J	I support hex, with 3, 4, 6 or 8 digits, with and without #; or (r, g, b) or (r, g, b, a)
2013-12-16 00:04:26	Espyo	ooh, nice
2013-12-16 00:04:36	@J	or a number 0xrrggbbaa
2013-12-16 00:04:41	Espyo	I just use what Allegro wants, though, no need to be fancier
2013-12-16 00:04:49	Espyo	which is al_map_rgb() or al_map_rgba()
2013-12-16 00:05:21	@J	sure, except it's faster both to write '000' and to understand it
2013-12-16 00:05:40	Espyo	yep
2013-12-16 00:05:45	@J	okay, need to design a level and come up with a name, then I'm done
2013-12-16 00:06:36	Espyo	I still have to do a fair bit
2013-12-16 00:06:46	Espyo	the main menu, particles, animating the enemy sprite
2013-12-16 00:12:04	@J	http://i.imgur.com/aYjeTsD.png http://i.imgur.com/kftFNuf.png http://i.imgur.com/LjxsflZ.png http://i.imgur.com/ImwWCVx.png
2013-12-16 00:16:46	Espyo	nice
2013-12-16 00:16:48	Espyo	it as a "you" style
2013-12-16 00:19:04	@J	by which you probably mean a mish-mash of styles
2013-12-16 00:19:26	@J	also, yes, those are boiler-shaped tanks with spider-like legs
2013-12-16 00:20:15	Espyo	heh, thought so
2013-12-16 00:20:48	@J	so, the other animation lag thing is that when a mine lands on the ground, it doesn't flip to the correct angle for a noticeable period of time
2013-12-16 00:20:54	@J	on walls and ceilings, it's fine
2013-12-16 00:20:57	@J	which is really strange
2013-12-16 00:21:03	@J	OH
2013-12-16 00:21:06	@J	I KNOW THINGS
2013-12-16 00:21:08	@J	I mean
2013-12-16 00:21:23	@J	I just worked out that the difference is because that would be the default angle
2013-12-16 00:21:29	@J	so there must be a bug with setting defaults
2013-12-16 00:21:41	@J	in fact, I just remembered I found the same thing with flipping
2013-12-16 00:22:36	@J	so...when you set a transform to the default value, possibly only for animations, it doesn't get applied until another change occurs (in these 2 cases, always when the next frame shows)
2013-12-16 00:25:16	Espyo	ah, makes sense
2013-12-16 00:48:50	@J	http://i.imgur.com/n2LD4NF.png
2013-12-16 00:48:53	@J	okay, there's the level
2013-12-16 00:50:07	@J	there are already 752 entries
2013-12-16 00:53:01	Espyo	WOW
2013-12-16 00:53:02	Espyo	caps
2013-12-16 01:00:40	@J	I'm considering the name 'anticlimax', because it's not unlikely that no-one will get hurt
2013-12-16 01:01:51	Espyo	hmm, right
2013-12-16 01:01:53	Espyo	but it's kinda vague
2013-12-16 01:02:06	@J	true
2013-12-16 01:04:38	@J	'boom', for the same reasons
2013-12-16 01:05:05	@J	 /evensubtler
2013-12-16 01:05:16	@J	strange, I forgot how to do the 0-width character thing
2013-12-16 01:05:30	@J	I think it was ctrl-something, ctrl-O
2013-12-16 01:05:35	Espyo	uhm...
2013-12-16 01:05:43	Espyo	there's the fixed-width space
2013-12-16 01:07:13	@J	yeah, that
2013-12-16 01:07:21	@J	forgot how to thingy it
2013-12-16 01:07:25	@J	anyway, boom it is
2013-12-16 01:07:30	@J	lowercase > all
2013-12-16 01:08:08	Espyo	no, it's ugly
2013-12-16 01:09:43	Espyo	also lowercase is only > uppercase
2013-12-16 01:09:57	@J	lies
2013-12-16 01:09:59	Espyo	it's not > ~, for instance
2013-12-16 01:10:03	@J	I should kick you right now
2013-12-16 01:10:04	Espyo	or {, or |, or }
2013-12-16 01:10:27	Espyo	I wonder how long it'll take you to realize I'm talking about ASCII values
2013-12-16 01:14:14	Espyo	hah!
2013-12-16 01:14:35	Espyo	to check if particles are working fine, I removed the death code and replaced it with just a spray of red particles
2013-12-16 01:14:42	Espyo	but because I never die, I'm just a walking fountain of blood
2013-12-16 01:16:55	@J	great
2013-12-16 01:16:59	@J	why not leave it in?
2013-12-16 01:17:08	Espyo	because you're a walking corpse
2013-12-16 01:17:21	Espyo	I'll leave it in for people to play around as a walking corpse during the fadeout
2013-12-16 01:17:26	Espyo	if I make it in time for a fadeout
2013-12-16 01:17:30	Espyo	I wanted to do more levels, but...
2013-12-16 01:18:18	@J	okay, submitted
2013-12-16 01:18:22	@J	now I really need to sleep
2013-12-16 01:18:23	@J	bye
2013-12-16 01:19:47	Espyo	bye

2013-12-16 22:31:28	@J	beep
2013-12-16 22:32:58	Espyo	bhey
2013-12-16 22:34:22	@J	http://paste2.org/B17a1zpB
2013-12-16 22:34:25	@J	fix it fix it
2013-12-16 22:34:31	Espyo	woah
2013-12-16 22:34:32	Espyo	it's so pertty
2013-12-16 22:34:35	Espyo	*pretty
2013-12-16 22:34:47	Espyo	oh, come on!...
2013-12-16 22:34:52	Espyo	what do you want from me, C++=
2013-12-16 22:34:53	Espyo	*?
2013-12-16 22:34:58	Espyo	I have no idea how to fix the first problem
2013-12-16 22:35:01	Espyo	I don't know what it's about
2013-12-16 22:35:09	Espyo	all I'm saying is that one of the arguments is an animation
2013-12-16 22:35:15	@J	they're all one problem
2013-12-16 22:35:22	Espyo	and if it's omitted, just create a default one
2013-12-16 22:35:26	Espyo	that works in other things
2013-12-16 22:35:39	@J	I don't really know how constructors work in C++
2013-12-16 22:35:50	@J	it gives a reason why each constructor is invalid
2013-12-16 22:36:02	Espyo	they're goofy, that's what they are
2013-12-16 22:36:08	@J	I don't really understand why it thinks you're passing in an animation
2013-12-16 22:36:14	Espyo	did you change anything in the code to fix other things?
2013-12-16 22:37:00	@J	probably no more helpful, but gcc says: http://paste2.org/Wt3Y28aZ
2013-12-16 22:37:09	@J	yes, I added '#include <string>' to that file
2013-12-16 22:37:37	Espyo	right
2013-12-16 22:37:40	Espyo	dunno why it needed it though
2013-12-16 22:37:46	Espyo	anyway, screw optional parameters
2013-12-16 22:37:50	Espyo	I'll do things the hard way
2013-12-16 22:38:20	@J	because you were using 'string'?
2013-12-16 22:38:59	Espyo	no, I mean VS compiled just fine
2013-12-16 22:39:03	Espyo	without any include of thesort
2013-12-16 22:39:04	Espyo	*sort
2013-12-16 22:39:20	Espyo	that file = vars.cpp?
2013-12-16 22:39:21	@J	because, as we've discovered before, VS includes standard library stuff without telling you
2013-12-16 22:39:22	@J	.h
2013-12-16 22:39:23	Espyo	or vars.h?
2013-12-16 22:39:27	Espyo	but but but
2013-12-16 22:39:30	Espyo	it never does
2013-12-16 22:39:32	Espyo	except sometimes
2013-12-16 22:39:41	Espyo	I always have to tell it to include string when I use strings
2013-12-16 22:39:43	@J	but still sometimes
2013-12-16 22:39:45	Espyo	but not sometimes...?
2013-12-16 22:39:47	Espyo	eugh
2013-12-16 22:40:08	@J	so, if I understand this, you can make an animation by copying another animation, by defining frames, or from nothing?
2013-12-16 22:40:25	Espyo	ok, so they're all not the same problem
2013-12-16 22:40:29	Espyo	one problem is creating objects
2013-12-16 22:40:35	Espyo	you can pass either a static bitmap or an animation
2013-12-16 22:40:46	Espyo	most of them use static bitmaps, so I made the animation parameter optional
2013-12-16 22:41:10	Espyo	and if the animation parameter is missing, it /should/ just fill in the "animation" attribute with an empty one
2013-12-16 22:41:13	@J	oh, also, the source download is missing img/
2013-12-16 22:41:16	Espyo	(using the empty constructor for that)
2013-12-16 22:41:27	Espyo	but apparently that's chinese to it
2013-12-16 22:41:31	Espyo	oh, I didn't want to duplicate files
2013-12-16 22:41:37	Espyo	src is for... source code
2013-12-16 22:41:38	Espyo	not resources
2013-12-16 22:41:44	@J	mm, I guess
2013-12-16 22:41:59	@J	should still be able to run it with just that distribution, though
2013-12-16 22:42:14	Espyo	yeah, guess so
2013-12-16 22:42:20	Espyo	oh, give me the makefile when you can
2013-12-16 22:42:29	Espyo	and Firefox recognizes makefile as a valid word
2013-12-16 22:42:31	Espyo	.................
2013-12-16 22:42:33	Espyo	but not "Firefox"
2013-12-16 22:42:48	@J	fun
2013-12-16 22:43:01	@J	I just copied one of the others I made and changed the binary name
2013-12-16 22:43:09	@J	I think PKRhythm's
2013-12-16 22:43:37	Espyo	hm, fair enough
2013-12-16 22:43:48	Espyo	shouldn't the Pikmin fangame engine one's be more...
2013-12-16 22:43:51	Espyo	uh, correct?
2013-12-16 22:43:55	Espyo	you made it more recently, so...
2013-12-16 22:43:57	Espyo	less past J mistakes
2013-12-16 22:44:12	@J	maybe
2013-12-16 22:44:16	@J	past J is very silly
2013-12-16 22:44:31	@J	I don't think I have that, since you added it to git
2013-12-16 22:45:03	Espyo	mhm
2013-12-16 22:45:49	Espyo	wait, now that I'm actually reading g++'s output
2013-12-16 22:45:59	Espyo	it's actually explaining why the constructors for animation aren't valid
2013-12-16 22:46:01	Espyo	that's great!
2013-12-16 22:46:03	@J	hmm, it just makes it search for source files recursively (not needed here) and uses C++0x (also apparently not needed here)
2013-12-16 22:46:06	Espyo	VS' compiler doesn't do that
2013-12-16 22:46:08	@J	...they both do
2013-12-16 22:46:22	@J	and I also pointed it out
2013-12-16 22:46:25	Espyo	yeah, gcc too
2013-12-16 22:46:32	Espyo	I guess I must've skimmed through
2013-12-16 22:46:32	@J	[22:35:50] @J it gives a reason why each constructor is invalid
2013-12-16 22:46:50	Espyo	right, at first, I thought it didn't even recognize I was trying to call a constructor
2013-12-16 22:47:02	Espyo	I thought it thought I was being random
2013-12-16 22:47:36	@J	which would be fair enough; you often are
2013-12-16 22:49:02	@J	also, I like your progress notes
2013-12-16 22:49:13	@J	it would be nice to look back at how long I took for everything
2013-12-16 22:49:23	@J	I think a few of the images took an hour each
2013-12-16 22:49:43	Espyo	mine didn't take that long, but still
2013-12-16 22:49:48	Espyo	also yesterday I made a last-minute change to all levels
2013-12-16 22:49:59	Espyo	made all levels have 2 jewels
2013-12-16 22:50:06	Espyo	...except that makes some steps of some levels optional

2013-12-16 23:16:28	@J	well done, we've uncovered a million other errors
2013-12-16 23:17:44	Espyo	yay
2013-12-16 23:21:28	@J	okay, reduced to 2 errors
2013-12-16 23:21:47	@J	and they're the same as before, but in different places
2013-12-16 23:21:51	Espyo	...
2013-12-16 23:22:12	@J	http://paste2.org/1zYXvwL1
2013-12-16 23:23:42	@J	okay, that's ridiculous
2013-12-16 23:24:10	@J	'ls' has so many options that when I accidentally didn't leave a gap between '-l' and some random text, it didn't find an invalid option until it met '/'
2013-12-16 23:24:24	@J	every character up until then was a valid option
2013-12-16 23:24:36	Espyo	what in the world is wrong with it?
2013-12-16 23:24:43	Espyo	it's an animation() constructor with no parameters
2013-12-16 23:24:47	Espyo	it exists! I created it!
2013-12-16 23:25:18	Espyo	ls is like the ultimate complex Linux command showcase
2013-12-16 23:27:46	Espyo	vars.h, line 43
2013-12-16 23:27:54	Espyo	animation(animation &a2) {
2013-12-16 23:27:55	Espyo	replace with
2013-12-16 23:27:58	Espyo	animation(const animation &a2) {
2013-12-16 23:28:04	Espyo	let's see if that's more for its liking

2013-12-16 23:32:02	Espyo	but gcc isn't bundled with any distro

2013-12-16 23:33:59	Espyo	...
2013-12-16 23:34:04	Espyo	I hate the VS compiler
2013-12-16 23:34:08	Espyo	what line is that?
2013-12-16 23:34:22	@J	functions.cpp, 48 and 50
2013-12-16 23:34:34	@J	only a warning, though, so it's not blocking anything
2013-12-16 23:34:49	Espyo	right
2013-12-16 23:34:56	Espyo	still, I told VS to compile with warning level 4
2013-12-16 23:34:59	Espyo	and it still didn't tell me about it
2013-12-16 23:35:08	@J	okay, it actually started compiling, but still failed
2013-12-16 23:35:23	Espyo	well, just changing the unsigned to signed on the function's header should work
2013-12-16 23:35:28	Espyo	(also on functions.h)
2013-12-16 23:49:46	@J	mm, got to go
2013-12-16 23:50:01	@J	I can help again tomorrow if you want, maybe
2013-12-16 23:50:06	@J	or I could just run the Windows version
2013-12-16 23:55:00	Espyo	I do want help tomorrow

2013-12-17 23:14:12	Espyo	too late now
2013-12-17 23:14:18	Espyo	oh, no it's not possible
2013-12-17 23:14:48	Espyo	level 5 is just the perfect level though
2013-12-17 23:15:01	Espyo	it's everything I wanted the other levels to be
2013-12-17 23:15:23	Espyo	you have two ways of completing it, and both ways require doing something before it's too late
2013-12-17 23:15:38	@J	I don't really see how to zipline there, though
2013-12-17 23:15:39	@J	in 4
2013-12-17 23:15:41	Espyo	it's easy to figure out what you had to do, regardless of the path, but by the time you figure it out, you probably have to restart
2013-12-17 23:15:50	Espyo	are you using the bridge?
2013-12-17 23:18:49	@J	yes
2013-12-17 23:19:11	Espyo	just before the zipline?
2013-12-17 23:19:24	Espyo	well, the zipline is meant to go straight through the exit
2013-12-17 23:24:42	@J	yeah, but I don't see how you stand high enough next to any of the walls to do that
2013-12-17 23:25:24	Espyo	you have the bridge, which creates a platform, allowing you to stand on higher ground
2013-12-17 23:25:35	Espyo	note that the bridge creates up to 3 bridges in front of you
2013-12-17 23:26:07	@J	what's going on with 6?
2013-12-17 23:26:19	@J	yes, but you can't stand high enough to place the bridge high enough?
2013-12-17 23:26:21	@J	*.
2013-12-17 23:26:31	Espyo	are you still stuck on 4 or what?
2013-12-17 23:30:07	@J	no, I finished it, but not by using the zipline to reach the exit
2013-12-17 23:30:15	Espyo	whaa
2013-12-17 23:30:18	Espyo	how, then?
2013-12-17 23:30:30	@J	I used the zipline to reach the gem, then grappled to the exit
2013-12-17 23:30:53	Espyo	but
2013-12-17 23:30:56	Espyo	there is no grapple on level 4
2013-12-17 23:30:57	Espyo	oh
2013-12-17 23:31:00	Espyo	wait, yeah there is
2013-12-17 23:31:21	Espyo	well, you know on the top-right there's a crevice going down?
2013-12-17 23:31:30	Espyo	that's why when you launch the zipline, you're too low to cross the exit
2013-12-17 23:31:36	Espyo	you need to place a bridge for more height
2013-12-17 23:31:46	Espyo	but the thing is, you place the bridge on the upper edge nearby, facing right
2013-12-17 23:31:59	Espyo	that creates 3 bridges, enough to reach the wall and be high enough to get the exit
2013-12-17 23:32:07	@J	wha
2013-12-17 23:32:16	@J	I did exactly that, but it only reaches the island with the gem
2013-12-17 23:32:23	Espyo	really?

2013-12-17 23:34:23	@J	also, the ladder sometimes disappears when you use it
2013-12-17 23:34:29	@J	I think maybe it gets placed inside a wall
2013-12-17 23:34:43	Espyo	oh, you can get on top of bridges too
2013-12-17 23:34:45	Espyo	not just walk on them
2013-12-17 23:35:00	Espyo	W moves up while swimming and climbing

2013-12-17 23:35:11	Espyo	so yeah, I could make it jump too
2013-12-17 23:35:15	Espyo	but oh well, too late now
2013-12-17 23:35:26	Espyo	yeah, I pointed it out on the submission page yesterday
2013-12-17 23:35:34	Espyo	(yesterday because I updated the post to warn about it)
2013-12-17 23:35:40	Espyo	on the last level, using it near the wall = poof
2013-12-17 23:37:07	@J	8 is pretty evil, if I'm doing it right
2013-12-17 23:37:16	Espyo	the start is a bit evil
2013-12-17 23:37:31	@J	just jump on bridges?
2013-12-17 23:37:44	Espyo	uh...
2013-12-17 23:37:55	Espyo	ugh, note to self
2013-12-17 23:38:06	Espyo	next time: don't hesitate to add a secret level skip feature
2013-12-17 23:38:14	Espyo	now I have to go all the way to level 8 to remind myself
2013-12-17 23:38:18	Espyo	either that or edit the source code
2013-12-17 23:38:53	@J	the water timing is tricky, the ladder glitch makes it worse, and the jump at the end doesn't really fit with the rest of the game
2013-12-17 23:39:11	@J	I usually add a command-line option to choose the level
2013-12-17 23:39:14	Espyo	don't get too close to the wall
2013-12-17 23:39:19	@J	and leave it in the game
2013-12-17 23:39:23	@J	yeah, I worked out the ladder
2013-12-17 23:39:25	Espyo	when placing the ladder, I mean
2013-12-17 23:39:27	@J	after a few failures
2013-12-17 23:39:38	Espyo	the jump at the end?
2013-12-17 23:39:43	Espyo	you mean going up to a block directly above you?
2013-12-17 23:39:47	@J	yeah
2013-12-17 23:39:48	Espyo	that was simple enough for me
2013-12-17 23:40:02	@J	it's not very hard, but I didn't think that's what I would have to do
2013-12-17 23:40:06	@J	it's just kind of weird
2013-12-17 23:40:14	Espyo	heh
2013-12-17 23:40:22	Espyo	that was actually an accident
2013-12-17 23:40:30	Espyo	the path to get up there was meant to be normal stairs
2013-12-17 23:40:37	Espyo	but for some reason, I messed up so badly it ended up like that
2013-12-17 23:40:41	@J	it seems like you just kind of wanted to put _something_ there, because it was empty
2013-12-17 23:40:47	@J	and had no items left to use
2013-12-17 23:41:05	Espyo	just as I was about to close the game to fix it to turn it into actual stairs, I decided to try to see if you could make the jump, and you could
2013-12-17 23:41:09	Espyo	and it's not super hard, so I left it in
2013-12-17 23:41:25	@J	anyway, yeah, that was pretty good
2013-12-17 23:41:32	@J	you should make puzzle games more often
2013-12-17 23:41:51	@J	actually, I don't recall you ever mentioning playing a puzzle game
2013-12-17 23:42:02	Espyo	heh, but I did
2013-12-17 23:42:05	Espyo	mostly flash games
2013-12-17 23:42:08	Espyo	oh, and there's Portal 1 and 2
2013-12-17 23:42:17	Espyo	speaking of which, I DID have a lot of fun making two custom maps on Portal 2
2013-12-17 23:42:21	Espyo	...really a lot of fun
2013-12-17 23:42:39	Espyo	and making the maps here was a bit fun too, though I had a time limit pressuring me
2013-12-17 23:42:47	@J	yeah, I think making levels for puzzle games is what got me into game development
2013-12-17 23:42:53	Espyo	but yeah, I'll have to try some more puzzle games, and next time, with better puzzle mechanics
2013-12-17 23:43:00	Espyo	it's easy to sequence break this game
2013-12-17 23:43:19	@J	yeah, I get the feeling I did that a fair amount, but it's hard to tell because of the humour
2013-12-17 23:43:20	Espyo	what got me into doing something remotely "game" related was crossword puzzles
2013-12-17 23:43:35	@J	I still don't get 6, the one with a load of gems above you
2013-12-17 23:43:37	Espyo	I have a sketchbook over here with some crossword puzzles by 8-year-old me
2013-12-17 23:43:43	@J	you just grapple up, get one, and fall back down
2013-12-17 23:43:48	Espyo	...don't tell me you hav—
2013-12-17 23:43:50	Espyo	NOO!
2013-12-17 23:43:51	Espyo	dammit!
2013-12-17 23:44:02	@J	you put it in for testing?
2013-12-17 23:44:08	Espyo	see, just before submitting, I decided to add more than one jewel to each stage
2013-12-17 23:44:14	Espyo	initially, 5 of them had 1 jewel only
2013-12-17 23:44:18	Espyo	I added more to fit the theme better
2013-12-17 23:44:22	Espyo	but I didn't test stuff right
2013-12-17 23:44:25	Espyo	so... that happened
2013-12-17 23:44:29	Espyo	I think I can fix it easily, though
2013-12-17 23:44:41	@J	hmm, but didn't that level already have gems up there?
2013-12-17 23:44:48	@J	because the comment told you to try the cannon
2013-12-17 23:45:53	@J	also, maybe I just missed it, but it should tell you about holding shift in the game
2013-12-17 23:45:58	@J	I only saw it on the description page
2013-12-17 23:46:19	Espyo	doesn't it say on the help screen?
2013-12-17 23:46:20	Espyo	nuts...
2013-12-17 23:46:25	Espyo	oh, it does say
2013-12-17 23:47:52	Espyo	anyway, some metal blocks on the top should do the trick
2013-12-17 23:48:38	Espyo	err... stone blocks, I mean
2013-12-17 23:48:45	Espyo	they were metal until very late into the game's development
2013-12-17 23:49:27	Espyo	listen, give me your code changes, please
2013-12-17 23:49:43	Espyo	so I can submit this version with a fixed level 6, hidden level skip, and actual Linux workingness
2013-12-17 23:50:32	@J	it was just the 'const', plus change the makefile to use 'find .' or just use 'wildcard' whatever it was from the PK Rhythm one
2013-12-17 23:51:09	@J	SRCS := $(shell find . -name '*.cpp')
2013-12-17 23:51:11	@J	that works
2013-12-17 23:51:15	Espyo	right
2013-12-17 23:51:30	Espyo	and no other kind of warnings besides that
2013-12-17 23:51:31	Espyo	*?
2013-12-17 23:52:05	Espyo	ugh, of course the makefile isn't meant to search on ./src
2013-12-17 23:52:42	@J	also, don't use zip, because it doesn't preserve permissions
2013-12-17 23:52:49	@J	...which you won't be able to set, anyway
2013-12-17 23:52:57	@J	oh, I think Git Bash magics them into working
2013-12-17 23:53:12	@J	no, that's everything
2013-12-17 23:53:22	@J	though images are still missing, of course
2013-12-17 23:53:32	Espyo	hm, any way to do .tar.gz without compressing into .gz and then into .tar using 7-zip?
2013-12-17 23:53:39	@J	but yeah, try in Git Bash: 'chmod +x theExecutableName'
2013-12-17 23:53:59	@J	then 'tar czf thing.tar.gz src/'
2013-12-17 23:54:10	Espyo	uh, executable name? you mean the windows executable?
2013-12-17 23:54:11	@J	7-zip isn't really built to separate archival and compression
2013-12-17 23:54:15	@J	no, the
2013-12-17 23:54:17	@J	...oh
2013-12-17 23:54:33	@J	never mind about any of this, then, for some reason I thought the source included a binary
2013-12-17 23:54:38	@J	zip is fine
2013-12-17 23:54:56	Espyo	source is source
2013-12-17 23:55:07	Espyo	also why I didn't include images
2013-12-17 23:55:10	Espyo	but I guess I should as well
2013-12-17 23:55:22	Espyo	listen, how would I go on about a Linux version download?
2013-12-17 23:55:30	Espyo	could you just shoot me your binary and that'd work?
2013-12-17 23:56:09	Espyo	oh, you'd need the updated source code, though
2013-12-17 23:56:14	Espyo	with the level skip and level 6 fix
2013-12-17 23:56:22	Espyo	I'm sure they won't mind those changes
2013-12-17 23:56:37	Espyo	one has no effect on gameplay whatsoever
2013-12-17 23:56:53	Espyo	it's a post-competition bonus, made to help people communicate levels better
2013-12-17 23:57:09	Espyo	"dude, you remember that part in level 7, where—" "I don't want to play again just to find out what level 7 is again"
2013-12-17 23:57:12	Espyo	except now they don't have to
2013-12-17 23:58:54	@J	http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-28/?action=preview&uid=16006
2013-12-17 23:58:57	@J	this is great
2013-12-17 23:59:08	Espyo	(updated source here: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Permanent/Caverns_of_the_Curse_of_Greed_src.7z)
2013-12-17 23:59:30	@J	the binary I have is 64-bit only, and requires Allegro to be installed
2013-12-17 23:59:39	Espyo	poop
2013-12-17 23:59:42	Espyo	no static linking then
2013-12-17 23:59:49	Espyo	can't blame you, it's hell to static link with Allegro
2013-12-17 23:59:57	@J	well, it's certainly possible, but I'm not sure how
2013-12-18 00:00:11	@J	I could probably stick the libraries in the package, though
2013-12-18 00:00:23	Espyo	eh, I'd rather leave people with the source code, to be frank
2013-12-18 00:00:35	Espyo	sucks, but it's better than making an unnecessary mess
2013-12-18 00:00:44	Espyo	guess I'll try to focus on HTML5 next LD
2013-12-18 00:00:50	Espyo	though HTML5 is so /sloooow/
2013-12-18 00:00:56	Espyo	also Chrome and Firefox can't get along
2013-12-18 00:01:13	Espyo	var abc = {}; abc[30] = 'hello';
2013-12-18 00:01:33	Espyo	this creates an associative array with one slot, '30', with the value 'hello', in Chrome
2013-12-18 00:01:51	Espyo	in Firefox, it creates an associative array with 30 indexes
2013-12-18 00:03:45	Espyo	okay, that monorail game doesn't work right on my computer
2013-12-18 00:03:54	Espyo	it doesn't clear the screen after every frame, so everything bleeds out
2013-12-18 00:04:07	Espyo	I doubt that's intended, because it looks horrible and it makes the game impossible to see after a few seconds
2013-12-18 00:04:36	@J	why do you #include allegro audio stuff if you have no sound?
2013-12-18 00:05:01	@J	yeah, using sparse arrays in JS is asking for trouble
2013-12-18 00:05:11	Espyo	because copy-paste
2013-12-18 00:05:34	Espyo	what other way can I do stuff that requires associative arrays without associative arrays?
2013-12-18 00:05:57	@J	wait, you mean if you do that, iterating over keys gives you 0..29?
2013-12-18 00:06:23	Espyo	yep
2013-12-18 00:06:28	Espyo	hang on, let me check for sure what I'm saing
2013-12-18 00:06:30	Espyo	*saying
2013-12-18 00:07:06	@J	works fine for me
2013-12-18 00:10:16	Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/bad%20ff.png
2013-12-18 00:11:01	Espyo	...ok, Chrome is doing it too
2013-12-18 00:15:47	@J	that's not what you said you did
2013-12-18 00:15:53	@J	that's a sparse array, not an object
2013-12-18 00:16:05	@J	and it's how JS is meant to work
2013-12-18 00:16:09	Espyo	right, right
2013-12-18 00:16:13	Espyo	I got the two mixed up
2013-12-18 00:16:19	Espyo	my JS is slightly rusty now
2013-12-18 00:16:30	Espyo	also what in the /world/ is up with my LD Dashboard?
2013-12-18 00:16:55	@J	?
2013-12-18 00:16:56	Espyo	is the "Activity" box meant to show everything, or...?
2013-12-18 00:17:02	Espyo	because I see a lot of crazy things
2013-12-18 00:17:12	Espyo	 From Devtactics on Livestream Your Games #      This is a great idea! I'd love to hear the reactions of someone trying my entry for the first time: http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-28/?action=preview&uid=775
2013-12-18 00:17:12	@J	oh, you mean how everyone shares a single set of posts
2013-12-18 00:17:19	@J	yeah, it's pretty crazily wrong
2013-12-18 00:17:20	Espyo	it's disorienting
2013-12-18 00:17:29	@J	it's just a shared Wordpress installation
2013-12-18 00:17:48	Espyo	and I have no idea how to change my avatar
2013-12-18 00:18:32	@J	I think it's a Gravatar thing
2013-12-18 00:18:34	@J	which is 3rd party
2013-12-18 00:18:39	@J	there might be a link somewhere
2013-12-18 00:18:45	@J	not like I ever bothered
2013-12-18 00:21:33	Espyo	bleh
2013-12-18 00:21:35	Espyo	screw it then
2013-12-18 00:21:47	Espyo	though if I set it up on Gravatar, I set it up here and on GitHub...
2013-12-18 00:21:58	Espyo	buh, but what's even the deal with having a site to host avatars everywhere?
2013-12-18 00:22:05	Espyo	seems so silly
2013-12-18 00:22:35	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/cotcog.tar.gz
2013-12-18 00:22:39	@J	this probably works on 64-bit
2013-12-18 00:22:46	Espyo	cotcog
2013-12-18 00:23:49	Espyo	(...)\cotcog\cotcog.sh: line 5: ./cotcog: No such file or directory
2013-12-18 00:24:09	Espyo	though it did write Run 'git help git' to display the help index. and the like
2013-12-18 00:24:23	Espyo	...
2013-12-18 00:24:28	Espyo	this is Linux
2013-12-18 00:24:33	@J	yes
2013-12-18 00:24:37	Espyo	took me far too long to realize that
2013-12-18 00:24:45	@J	weird it would say no such file, though
2013-12-18 00:25:04	Espyo	windows is trying to run a .sh like a .bat
2013-12-18 00:27:09	Espyo	ugh, permissions
2013-12-18 00:27:17	Espyo	what's the command line command to decompress .tar.gz?
2013-12-18 00:27:58	@J	tar xf <filename>
2013-12-18 00:28:36	@J	also 'tar x < filename' - that one's a literal '<'
2013-12-18 00:31:19	@J	I should really get to sleep now
2013-12-18 00:31:20	@J	bye
2013-12-18 00:34:28	Espyo	bye
2013-12-18 00:40:00	Espyo	fine, impossible to execute binary file
2013-12-18 00:40:14	Espyo	dammit, why does this type of stuff have to be so impossibly complicated?

2013-12-18 18:30:06	Testyo	Hi everyone!
2013-12-18 19:42:49	@J	what kind of stuff?
2013-12-18 19:43:32	Espyo	context?
2013-12-18 19:44:20	@J	[00:40:14] Espyo dammit, why does this type of stuff have to be so impossibly complicated?
2013-12-18 19:44:44	Espyo	ports
2013-12-18 19:44:45	Espyo	C++
2013-12-18 19:44:47	Espyo	linkers
2013-12-18 19:44:52	Espyo	command lines
2013-12-18 19:44:54	Espyo	compilers
2013-12-18 19:44:55	Espyo	everything
2013-12-18 19:44:55	@J	mm
2013-12-18 19:45:01	@J	probably because computers are complex
2013-12-18 19:45:19	Espyo	we've simplified a load of things
2013-12-18 19:45:21	@J	and because of industrial competition
2013-12-18 19:45:27	Espyo	by creating systems that take care of all the hard work
2013-12-18 19:45:42	Espyo	but why is compiling in C++ still wizardry only fit to those worthy of knowing the secrets of the universe?
2013-12-18 19:45:54	@J	because C++ isn't one of those systems
2013-12-18 19:46:00	@J	it's like 40 years old
2013-12-18 19:46:17	Espyo	all the more years for people to make it easier
2013-12-18 19:46:36	@J	which they have done, by inventing non-C++ languages
2013-12-18 19:46:53	Espyo	but non-C++ is not C++
2013-12-18 19:47:02	@J	exactly - isn't it great?
2013-12-18 19:47:10	Espyo	that's where another problem lies
2013-12-18 19:47:23	Espyo	for stuff that isn't complex to port and whatnot, like say, Java or HTML
2013-12-18 19:47:28	Espyo	it's incredibly heavy
2013-12-18 19:47:32	Espyo	there's no middle-ground
2013-12-18 19:47:44	Espyo	or there is, but it belongs to one of those obscure languages that have no support
2013-12-18 19:47:57	@J	what do you mean by 'heavy', here?
2013-12-18 19:48:10	Espyo	HTML5 games are really slow
2013-12-18 19:48:29	Espyo	and as for Java... well, if Minecraft was made in C++, it'd run twice as fast
2013-12-18 19:48:32	Espyo	provided it was done well
2013-12-18 19:48:37	@J	mm
2013-12-18 19:48:43	@J	Java isn't very slow
2013-12-18 19:48:59	@J	most of Minecraft is GPU-heavy, so it's just because of the way it does OpenGL
2013-12-18 19:49:00	Espyo	not really C++-fast either
2013-12-18 19:49:06	Espyo	true
2013-12-18 19:49:14	@J	the GPU stuff is going to be the same in any case
2013-12-18 19:49:18	Espyo	the other half is because, according to the modders, the source code is the worst thing imaginable
2013-12-18 19:49:29	@J	yes, but that's not Java's fault
2013-12-18 19:49:36	Espyo	still, stuff like the VM and garbage collection takes a toll on Java's performance
2013-12-18 19:49:44	Espyo	could be the difference between 60FPS and 55
2013-12-18 19:49:50	Espyo	 5FPS is important
2013-12-18 19:49:56	Espyo	namely because it's more than 0
2013-12-18 19:50:09	Espyo	(not sure if "namely" is the word to use there)
2013-12-18 19:50:17	@J	except you're just making up numbers
2013-12-18 19:50:29	@J	it could be the difference between 60.1 FPS and 60.0 FPS
2013-12-18 19:50:33	Espyo	depends
2013-12-18 19:50:43	@J	well, yeah, that's exactly my poit
2013-12-18 19:50:45	@J	*point
2013-12-18 19:51:08	Espyo	still, in the overall image...
2013-12-18 19:51:15	Espyo	also, I don't like Java in the first place, so
2013-12-18 19:51:18	@J	anyway, yeah, I'm just playing Devil's advocate because your argument is kind of terrible
2013-12-18 19:51:35	Espyo	and learning a new language+framework just to make games that aren't a pain to compile...
2013-12-18 19:51:38	Espyo	is even more painful
2013-12-18 19:51:51	@J	hmm, really?
2013-12-18 19:52:01	@J	learning a new language makes you better at every language
2013-12-18 19:52:21	@J	it puts you in a position to make a better decision about what to use for each project
2013-12-18 19:52:46	Espyo	in the long run
2013-12-18 19:52:49	Espyo	still takes a bit to learn
2013-12-18 19:53:14	Espyo	I don't quite mind, but in order to take advantage of the new language, you have to know its ins and outs
2013-12-18 19:53:19	Espyo	and that takes more than just "knowing" the language
2013-12-18 19:54:55	@J	anyway, as for usable, fast languages, it obviously depends on what use case you're talking about, but Rust is looking promising
2013-12-18 19:55:09	Espyo	Rust? doesn't ring a bell
2013-12-18 20:00:48	@J	it's a Mozilla thing
2013-12-18 20:00:54	@J	C-like, but modern
2013-12-18 20:01:11	@J	compiles to native code
2013-12-18 20:01:15	Espyo	hmm
2013-12-18 20:01:17	Espyo	sounds good
2013-12-18 20:03:54	@J	you might also like D, actually
2013-12-18 20:04:00	@J	which is pretty mature, more like C++
2013-12-18 20:04:22	Espyo	that one I think I heard about
2013-12-18 20:04:35	Espyo	though without a game-making framework, it won't help too much...
2013-12-18 20:04:38	@J	it has that whole 'let's put everything in a language so everyone likes it' mentality
2013-12-18 20:04:50	Espyo	ooh
2013-12-18 20:04:52	Espyo	I like that idea
2013-12-18 20:04:57	Espyo	seems like it'd bloat it, though
2013-12-18 20:05:05	@J	yes, like C++
2013-12-18 20:05:22	Espyo	well, more than C++
2013-12-18 20:09:07	@J	?
2013-12-18 20:10:11	Espyo	more bloated than C++ is in relation to C
2013-12-18 20:10:19	Espyo	or maybe not
2013-12-18 20:10:26	Espyo	I don't know enough about D to say that

2013-12-18 20:52:29	Espyo	heh, you could at least made the title screen a bit yellow
2013-12-18 20:52:43	Espyo	but eh, not like my title screen is the most beautiful piece of art there is
2013-12-18 20:53:52	Espyo	oh, it's walljumping
2013-12-18 20:56:27	Espyo	the controls could be less confusing
2013-12-18 20:56:39	Espyo	on one player, ctrl is to place the real mine, but on another it's detonate
2013-12-18 21:14:32	Prezintenden	ohhhhh art, i am all about that stuff
2013-12-18 21:14:58	Prezintenden	is this like genuine graphic-art or just code?
2013-12-18 21:16:44	Espyo	J's super beautiful intro screen for his Ludum Dare game
2013-12-18 21:18:43	Prezintenden	that didn't answer my question :(

2013-12-18 21:26:33	Espyo	he doesn't have a screenshot of the title screen, but

2013-12-18 21:39:44	@J	well, you're not exactly meant to play both players
2013-12-18 21:40:14	@J	title screen is because I ran out of time
2013-12-18 21:40:38	@J	they(it depends on how many controllers are plugged in)'re just raster graphics
2013-12-18 21:40:45	@J	though the background is defined in code
2013-12-18 21:41:06	@J	and yeah, keyboard controls are pretty poor
2013-12-18 21:41:18	@J	a better layout is appreciated, if you can think of one
2013-12-18 21:41:34	@J	should be able to edit evt/* and have it update with a restart, if you feel like testing
2013-12-18 21:41:50	@J	*would be appreciated, I should probably say
2013-12-18 21:43:57	@J	yay kiwi
2013-12-18 22:07:13	Espyo	read that as yay wiki
2013-12-18 22:07:43	Espyo	a bigger layout for the arena would be enough
2013-12-18 22:07:46	Espyo	not TOO big, just enough
2013-12-18 22:09:29	@J	hmm, yeah
2013-12-18 22:11:35	@J	yeah, I think I did originally imagine it larger, but that's just how big I happened to do the graphics, and I never thought to increase the window size

2013-12-19 19:57:20	Espyo	if you remember it from those screenshots, then it's one thing, but if you remember them from in-game, that's another
2013-12-19 19:57:35	@J	wait, what are those screenshots, then?
2013-12-19 19:57:42	@J	are they beta or something?

2013-12-19 19:58:53	@J	did you upload all those manually?
2013-12-19 19:59:42	Espyo	those screenshots are from unused cave setups, on TCRF
2013-12-19 19:59:58	Espyo	they are in-game, they replaced existing cave layouts with some unused ones that happen to contain way4_toy
2013-12-19 20:00:09	Espyo	I had nothing to do with those TCRF shots though
2013-12-19 20:00:28	@J	so did any used files reference way4_toy?
2013-12-19 20:00:40	@J	if not, I guess that's your answer and I'm just making things up (as usual)
2013-12-19 20:00:49	@J	[16:14:55] Prez uhhhh make a page for crystal nodules? they're named in the game and don't really
2013-12-19 20:00:49	@J	form a hazard so...
2013-12-19 20:00:54	@J	yeah, I don't see why not
2013-12-19 20:01:34	@J	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Category:Obstacles
2013-12-19 20:01:40	@J	most other obstacles have their own page
2013-12-19 20:01:40	Espyo	some used ones DO reference it, but
2013-12-19 20:01:49	Espyo	I don't think the units the game is given ever allow for them to be placed
2013-12-19 20:02:02	Espyo	although PikFan says he spotted way4_toy on a 2P level
2013-12-19 20:02:07	Espyo	or thinks he did
2013-12-19 20:02:32	Espyo	so... what's a crystal nodule?
2013-12-19 20:02:37	@J	I was thinking one of those ones with paths around the edges, like the Gatling Groink on the bucket (Challenge Mode?)

2013-12-19 20:34:57	Espyo	hmm
2013-12-19 20:35:07	Espyo	really don't remember any in that kind of environment

2013-12-19 20:45:02	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:P2CU_room_hebi12x12_1_tsuchi.jpg where in the world is this used?
2013-12-19 20:45:13	Espyo	according to the files, sublevel 5 of forest_2.txt
2013-12-19 20:45:16	Espyo	which is some AW cave
2013-12-19 20:45:22	Espyo	but no sublevel 5 matches
2013-12-19 20:45:33	Espyo	the Snagret Hole's sublevel 5 is metallic, according to the wiki
2013-12-19 20:49:14	Espyo	oh, sublevel 5 of the White Flower Garden
2013-12-19 21:04:31	Prez	crystal nodules are just rocks that rock pikmin can destroy. think interactable cannon beetle rocks
2013-12-19 21:04:40	Prez	in case the question was still relevant
2013-12-19 21:06:02	Espyo	ah
2013-12-19 21:06:04	Espyo	hmm
2013-12-19 21:06:08	Espyo	I guess they should be obstacles
2013-12-19 21:06:12	Espyo	depends if they get in the way or not
2013-12-19 21:07:24	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Cave_units done
2013-12-19 21:08:04	Prez	mmmmmmmmmmmm... there are "crystal" walls. look like glass, not sure what the game calls them at the moment. many enemies have crystal armor... and the nodules, they lie around, but they don't block anything i think. hmmmm
2013-12-19 21:08:37	Espyo	not really sure they're obstacles then
2013-12-19 21:08:40	Espyo	what are they for, then?
2013-12-19 21:08:43	Espyo	do they contain stuff inside?
2013-12-19 21:09:19	Prez	maybe it would either be better to have a page for all things crystal (sounds dumb, probably bad idea) or just add it to other articles and the rock pikmin page. pretty sure skutterchucks are the only enemies that interact with the nodules, but i might have forgotten something
2013-12-19 21:09:40	Espyo	hmm
2013-12-19 21:09:48	Espyo	well, I don't know enough about them to vote on the matter
2013-12-19 21:10:40	Prez	there are crystals that block the path or contain stuff that aren't crystal walls in the sense dirt/bramble gates are. but they aren't called nodules, just crystals or something. hmm maybe a crystal article makes sense after all, considering the big chucks of crystals. wait do they block paths actually? i don't think so. but they do contain stuff often
2013-12-19 21:11:02	Prez	yeah, i need to check again, i didn't pay much attention to them until just now
2013-12-19 21:11:51	Prez	pfff scales are obstacles? hah
2013-12-19 21:12:38	Prez	man espyo that article is amazing
2013-12-19 21:13:15	Espyo	thanks
2013-12-19 21:13:36	Espyo	I plan on changing all cave + challenge + 2P articles to include a list of all possible units for each sublevel
2013-12-19 21:13:39	Prez	these are exactly the textures used in the game, just stretched right?
2013-12-19 21:13:49	Espyo	hopefully with galleries that aren't that huge
2013-12-19 21:13:51	Espyo	textures?
2013-12-19 21:14:03	Espyo	those are screenshots I took from the units themselves, using a model viewer
2013-12-19 21:14:08	Espyo	but the units do come from the game directly
2013-12-19 21:14:23	Prez	OH
2013-12-19 21:14:45	Prez	okay. i was thinking 
2013-12-19 21:14:53	Prez	well i'm not really sure. but i get it now
2013-12-19 21:15:28	Prez	basically i thought this was max resolution
2013-12-19 21:15:52	Espyo	heh nope
2013-12-19 21:15:53	Prez	but yeah looking at it again that would be way too pixelated
2013-12-19 21:16:00	Espyo	only as big as I could take screenshots of
2013-12-19 21:16:10	Espyo	though I did shrink most of them
2013-12-19 21:16:18	Espyo	because c'mon, there's 216 of them (dupes included)

2013-12-19 21:19:19	@J	oh, I was thinking of those
2013-12-19 21:19:36	@J	like the mushrooms?
2013-12-19 21:19:51	@J	yeah, scales are things you need to overcome to get somewhere
2013-12-19 21:19:56	Prez	yeah i didn't even think of those when i made the nodules link. will need to look at it more closely

2013-12-19 21:20:29	Espyo	good job, mibbit
2013-12-19 21:21:39	Prez	my thought process was more like scales allow you to overcome the real obstacle, walls, so it would be more of a help
2013-12-19 21:21:50	Prez	but in the videogame sense, yeah, they're obstacles
2013-12-19 21:23:20	@J	hmm, I thought it would be more, but that page is only 878KiB total
2013-12-19 21:23:48	@J	ah, you didn't scale them down as much as you originally intended
2013-12-19 21:23:50	@J	that's good
2013-12-19 21:24:09	@J	I like how the abyss is an actual part of some models
2013-12-19 21:27:21	Espyo	yeah
2013-12-19 21:27:27	Espyo	it's actually wall, not abyss

2013-12-19 21:32:11	@J	supersonic speeds.'
2013-12-19 21:32:14	@J	sad indeed
2013-12-19 21:34:51	Espyo	dammit
2013-12-19 21:35:19	Espyo	thanks for suggesting my own game as a game to play, ludumdare.com
2013-12-19 21:36:18	@J	it does cover collisions involving aircraft, though
2013-12-19 21:36:36	@J	yeah, I got that too
2013-12-19 21:39:05	Espyo	yay, someone praised my character's animations
2013-12-19 21:39:25	Espyo	"although the character does move well"
2013-12-19 21:39:28	Espyo	not necessarily the animations, but
2013-12-19 21:39:54	Espyo	it's really stressing when people don't seem to catch on about stuff that's obvious to you
2013-12-19 21:40:24	@J	like what?
2013-12-19 21:40:36	@J	I thought the animations were nice too
2013-12-19 21:40:56	@J	or, I should say, it was pleasing that there _were_ animations for a variety of actions
2013-12-19 21:42:04	Espyo	right
2013-12-19 21:42:19	Espyo	I wouldn't call them nice, but I'm glad I gave them as much detail as I did
2013-12-19 21:42:27	Espyo	would've made some more, like... NOT 4 frames for running
2013-12-19 21:42:29	Espyo	but time...
2013-12-19 21:42:36	Espyo	also I mean the fact that shift shows help about the items
2013-12-19 21:42:42	Espyo	and that 2 jewels = death
2013-12-19 21:42:50	Espyo	at least 2 people've complained about those problems
2013-12-19 21:48:25	@J	4 frames is always enough
2013-12-19 21:48:27	Espyo	so what's up with the previously rated entries having the columns duplicated?
2013-12-19 21:48:49	Espyo	and the final game I reviewed having the ratings on the 2nd set of attributes?
2013-12-19 21:48:53	@J	yeah, the 2 gems thing is like the whole point of the game
2013-12-19 21:49:08	@J	one is probably compo, one jam
2013-12-19 21:49:12	Espyo	or part of it, but it sure is pointed in the title
2013-12-19 21:49:13	Espyo	ah, makes sense
2013-12-19 21:49:34	@J	I had that sort of stuff a lot with Wearhouse
2013-12-19 21:49:38	Espyo	what's the txt column? there's only one, and x on all of them
2013-12-19 21:49:41	@J	people just weren't getting the mechanics
2013-12-19 21:49:44	Espyo	right
2013-12-19 21:49:53	Espyo	it's really nerve-wrecking

2013-12-19 21:49:56	Espyo	dinner
2013-12-19 21:49:57	@J	but I couldn't understand it

2013-12-19 22:14:44	Espyo	it's done, it's done
2013-12-19 22:15:04	Espyo	I'll have to live with knowing that the items aren't as easy to understand as I'd hope
2013-12-19 22:15:13	Espyo	I won't make the same mistake next LD, though, I hope
2013-12-19 22:16:53	@J	you mean for LD, or you don't plan to continue this game at all?
2013-12-19 22:17:42	@J	because I'd say it's good enough that it's worth fixing all the little bugs/usability issues, adding some sound, maybe some more levels
2013-12-19 22:18:46	Espyo	hmm
2013-12-19 22:18:54	Espyo	well, I suppose I should work on an updated version at one point
2013-12-19 22:18:58	Espyo	but certainly not for LD

2013-12-19 23:13:25	@J	stdin default is pretty common
2013-12-19 23:13:59	@J	-f defines the archive, whether you're reading into one or out of one

2013-12-19 23:14:43	@J	not sure why I went into 'hey look here's some information' mode there
2013-12-19 23:15:09	Espyo	because it's appreciated

2013-12-19 23:16:05	@J	yes, I suppose you need libpng

2013-12-19 23:19:21	@J	so, the allegro build is linked against libpng16, but Ubuntu ships with 12
2013-12-19 23:19:32	@J	however, that means allegro5 must support libpng12

2013-12-21 22:56:57	@J	not that I've discovered, no
2013-12-21 22:57:03	@J	it's a fairly horrible system
2013-12-21 22:57:11	Espyo	yeah, so I learned...
2013-12-21 22:57:14	@J	you can subscribe to every comment on every post ever
2013-12-21 22:57:28	Espyo	subscribe to what, changes?
2013-12-21 22:57:33	Espyo	edits, I mean
2013-12-21 22:57:38	Espyo	because you certainly can't reply to a comment
2013-12-21 22:57:40	Espyo	not as far as I know
2013-12-21 22:57:48	Espyo	oh, maybe blog post comments
2013-12-21 22:59:53	@J	I don't even know
2013-12-21 23:00:15	@J	https://www.changedetection.com/
2013-12-21 23:00:19	@J	you can always try that
2013-12-21 23:00:34	@J	and hope it doesn't constantly pick up sidebar changes, etc.
2013-12-21 23:02:00	Espyo	oh, neat
2013-12-21 23:02:12	Espyo	it should be fairly simple to limit it to a certain HTML element...
2013-12-21 23:03:08	Espyo	https://www.changedetection.com/faq.html
2013-12-21 23:03:14	Espyo	apparently it kinda is
2013-12-21 23:04:00	@J	not very useful, though
2013-12-21 23:04:03	Espyo	>Typically pages are checked once per day for changes. 
2013-12-21 23:04:07	Espyo	doesn't help me then
2013-12-21 23:04:13	@J	?
2013-12-21 23:04:14	Espyo	I already manually check once a day
2013-12-21 23:04:50	Espyo	off-topic, is the wiki down? http://www.pikminwiki.com
2013-12-21 23:05:30	@J	I suppose a site like that which allows you to specify what to look at, how often to check, etc., would be useful
2013-12-21 23:05:45	Gamefreak75	all the wikis that belong to porplemontage are down
2013-12-21 23:05:47	@J	I find I need to do that fairly often, so I might consider doing it
2013-12-21 23:05:57	@J	Gamefreak75: do we know why?
2013-12-21 23:06:12	Gamefreak75	no idea, it's been down for about 3 hours
2013-12-21 23:06:19	Espyo	hmm
2013-12-21 23:06:22	Espyo	should be temporary
2013-12-21 23:06:22	@J	actually, doing it as an RSS feed fixes the frequency thing quite nicely
2013-12-21 23:06:29	Espyo	yeah, it does
2013-12-21 23:07:06	@J	though I suppose it means you should be keeping a backlog of previous changes at times of request
2013-12-21 23:07:08	@J	hmm
2013-12-21 23:07:31	@J	anyway, I already have an HTML parsing library I wrote forever ago, with CSS-style selections
2013-12-21 23:07:43	Espyo	right
2013-12-21 23:07:53	@J	not that it's well-written, but it seems to work
2013-12-21 23:08:03	Espyo	still sounds like it would have hundreds of problems
2013-12-21 23:08:24	@J	which part?
2013-12-21 23:08:41	Espyo	the page updater idea as a whole
2013-12-21 23:08:43	Espyo	not your library
2013-12-21 23:09:16	@J	you have any particular worries, or just vague suspicion?
2013-12-21 23:10:20	Espyo	suspicion, but I guess that I'm worried that the servers you're meant to check might not like the idea?
2013-12-21 23:10:29	@J	hmm
2013-12-21 23:10:37	Espyo	having a request from the same IP every time, every X hours
2013-12-21 23:10:42	Espyo	suspicious behaviour
2013-12-21 23:10:45	@J	depends how often it gets used, really
2013-12-21 23:10:46	Espyo	you'd have to ask permissions
2013-12-21 23:11:02	@J	but there are already lots of things that do that kind of thing
2013-12-21 23:11:34	@J	it's no different from checking manually, just more predictable
2013-12-21 23:11:53	@J	and hey, if that site doesn't have a problem with it...
2013-12-21 23:13:03	Espyo	I suppose

2013-12-21 23:19:38	@PikFan	I've played too far into the game

2013-12-21 23:20:05	Espyo	don't you have a save file with less days?

2013-12-21 23:49:17	Espyo	then I remembered to go to the wiki

2013-12-21 23:49:32	Espyo	and after those events, that lead to me asking you
2013-12-21 23:49:32	@PikFan	then I...
2013-12-21 23:49:40	Espyo	Los Plagas finds out about the different links at the same time?

2013-12-28 14:39:10	Espyo	that only means they were bored, browsed around, and just read the bugs

2013-12-28 14:47:26	@J	hmm, could be nice
2013-12-28 14:47:33	@J	I'm not sure all the technical stuff is necessary
2013-12-28 14:47:36	@J	I mean
2013-12-28 14:47:45	@J	it would be nice to make it auto-collapsed or something
2013-12-28 14:47:46	Espyo	it's not, but it's not unnecessary
2013-12-28 14:47:54	Espyo	isn't it already auto-collapsed?
2013-12-28 14:48:01	@J	no
2013-12-28 14:48:03	Espyo	it starts small for me
2013-12-28 14:48:08	Espyo	I have to click the expand button

2013-12-28 14:48:49	@J	ah, now I see it
2013-12-28 14:48:53	@J	yes, that's better
2013-12-28 14:49:19	@J	some of the field names could probably be clearer
2013-12-28 14:49:27	@J	but I'm not sure how
2013-12-28 14:49:29	Espyo	I still need to check them 100%
2013-12-28 14:49:39	Espyo	also a {{tt}} would help explaining some of them
2013-12-28 14:49:52	Espyo	* maximum is pretty obvious
2013-12-28 14:50:05	@J	mm, still sounds a little weird
2013-12-28 14:50:11	@J	without a 'number of'
2013-12-28 14:50:11	Espyo	unit and lighting file is more technical, it only really matters to those who know what they want
2013-12-28 14:50:24	Espyo	I had a bit of trouble wrestling with what to call those to be frank
2013-12-28 14:50:35	Espyo	I think they used to be "maximum number of items", or some such
2013-12-28 14:50:47	@J	but it probably looked repetitive
2013-12-28 14:50:52	Espyo	mhm
2013-12-28 14:50:52	@J	I can see that

2013-12-28 14:51:08	Espyo	this is going to be a template, no question about it
2013-12-28 14:51:14	Espyo	but adding the list of cave units...
2013-12-28 14:51:26	Espyo	I cannot figure out how to do it by a template
2013-12-28 14:51:57	@J	make a second template
2013-12-28 14:52:24	@J	{{infothing|units={{caveunit|blah}} {{caveunit|blech}} }}
2013-12-28 14:57:08	<--	Espyo (Mibbit@l24-248-52-895.cpe.netcabo.pt) has quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
2013-12-28 14:57:41	-->	Espyo (Mibbit@l24-248-52-895.cpe.netcabo.pt) has joined #pikipedia
2013-12-28 14:57:52	Espyo	what in the world is up with mibbit, good grief
2013-12-28 14:58:10	Espyo	anyway, the problem is that it's image image image image |- name name name name
2013-12-28 14:58:14	Espyo	different rows
2013-12-28 14:58:21	Espyo	unless we have tables inside tables...
2013-12-28 15:09:52	@J	oh, didn't realise that
2013-12-28 15:11:09	@J	why not use a gallery?
2013-12-28 15:12:42	Espyo	too huge, I think
2013-12-28 15:12:45	Espyo	worth giving it a shot
2013-12-28 15:12:50	Espyo	don't know if I can set the padding though
2013-12-28 15:12:58	Espyo	also right now, all cells are 128x128, painted purple
2013-12-28 15:13:06	Espyo	so it looks like the image of the cave unit is centered
2013-12-28 15:13:14	Espyo	off-topic: how do I negate in regex?
2013-12-28 15:13:22	@J	hmm
2013-12-28 15:13:31	@J	you can negate characters using [^...]
2013-12-28 15:13:39	@J	but not sure if it works for phrases
2013-12-28 15:13:55	Espyo	ah, ^
2013-12-28 15:13:56	Espyo	I was doing !
2013-12-28 15:14:01	Espyo	*shrug*
2013-12-28 15:14:22	Espyo	gotta try to see if any floor has that mysterious "Hidden floor" (隠し床) parameter set to anything that ISN'T 0
2013-12-28 15:17:38	@J	trying to briefly list features of my game engine
2013-12-28 15:17:41	@J	http://sprunge.us/ZSQe
2013-12-28 15:17:44	@J	what doesn't make sense?
2013-12-28 15:19:06	Espyo	the first bullet point
2013-12-28 15:19:13	Espyo	ok, not really
2013-12-28 15:19:14	@J	hmm, yeah, probably
2013-12-28 15:19:15	Espyo	it makes some sense
2013-12-28 15:19:28	Espyo	- automatic framerate adjustment for slowdown
2013-12-28 15:19:35	Espyo	does this really change the framerate to compensate slowdown?
2013-12-28 15:19:44	Espyo	or does it just use timing based on real time?
2013-12-28 15:19:46	@J	it means you can run a world, then from there start another world, then when that world stops it goes back to the first world in the state it was
2013-12-28 15:19:55	@J	it changes the framerate
2013-12-28 15:19:58	Espyo	right, it's what I imagined
2013-12-28 15:20:04	@J	hmm
2013-12-28 15:20:05	Espyo	hmm, the other way I said would be better for that
2013-12-28 15:20:21	@J	it's a little ambiguous
2013-12-28 15:20:27	Espyo	like, every iteration of the main loop
2013-12-28 15:20:34	Espyo	check how much time has passed since the last iteration
2013-12-28 15:20:34	@J	there's drawing framerate and update rate
2013-12-28 15:20:37	Espyo	and then use that for timing
2013-12-28 15:20:43	Espyo	instead of moving framerates up and down
2013-12-28 15:20:50	@J	update rate is fixed - this isn't really a variable-framerate timer
2013-12-28 15:21:03	@J	drawing framerate (the actual 'frame rate') varies
2013-12-28 15:21:04	Espyo	is the update rate 100% CPU?
2013-12-28 15:21:19	@J	no
2013-12-28 15:21:24	@J	it's a fixed rate
2013-12-28 15:21:28	Espyo	ah
2013-12-28 15:21:35	Espyo	say, may I see your interpolation code real quick?
2013-12-28 15:21:42	@J	which part?
2013-12-28 15:21:53	Espyo	the part that does actual interpolation between two values
2013-12-28 15:22:15	@J	linear interpolation?
2013-12-28 15:22:21	Espyo	or rather...
2013-12-28 15:22:24	Espyo	something that isn't linear
2013-12-28 15:22:31	Espyo	yeah, that's what I want, the non-linear ones
2013-12-28 15:22:50	Espyo	just curious to see if I'm doing something horribly wrong on the PFE
2013-12-28 15:22:58	Espyo	I /shouldn't/, but knowing my luck, I probably am
2013-12-28 15:23:15	@J	mm
2013-12-28 15:23:27	@J	https://github.com/ikn/pygame-template/blob/master/game/engine/sched.py#L175
2013-12-28 15:23:28	Espyo	- automatic input normalisation to avoid missing buttons that were pressed too early
2013-12-28 15:23:30	Espyo	?
2013-12-28 15:23:39	Espyo	thanks
2013-12-28 15:23:53	@J	if you're holding right when the game starts, you get a keydown event and the guy starts walking
2013-12-28 15:24:08	@J	that link is the function that does damped motion towards a target
2013-12-28 15:24:28	@J	all of the interpolation stuff is in that file, if it's something else you were after
2013-12-28 15:25:05	Espyo	ah
2013-12-28 15:25:17	Espyo	I figured, but calling it input normalisation doesn't seem right
2013-12-28 15:25:26	Espyo	right, I'm just seeing around the file
2013-12-28 15:25:34	Espyo	yeah, it's pretty much the only way to do interpolation really
2013-12-28 15:26:07	@J	well, it determines the state of various inputs and normalises them
2013-12-28 15:26:51	Espyo	dunno, it's just not easy to immediately see what that feature is
2013-12-28 15:27:06	Espyo	- simple deadzones for axes
2013-12-28 15:27:11	Espyo	you are doing these correctly, aren't you? hehe
2013-12-28 15:27:16	@J	hopefully
2013-12-28 15:27:22	Espyo	there was an article on gamasutra some months ago
2013-12-28 15:27:26	@J	they're linear, with 0 at the deadzone point
2013-12-28 15:27:33	Espyo	http://gamasutra.com/blogs/JoshSutphin/20130415/190541/Doing_Thumbstick_Dead_Zones_Right.php
2013-12-28 15:27:35	@J	yeah, you linked to it
2013-12-28 15:27:51	Espyo	very strangely, I have absolutely no need to do anything of the sort
2013-12-28 15:27:57	Espyo	uh... maybe it's Allegro doing magic
2013-12-28 15:28:01	Espyo	or maybe my controller sucks
2013-12-28 15:28:10	Espyo	but the truth is, I never needed to handle deadzones in the PFE
2013-12-28 15:29:44	@J	hmm
2013-12-28 15:30:08	@J	I find that my Xbox 360 controller can go up to around 0.17 while not touching it
2013-12-28 15:30:16	Espyo	wow
2013-12-28 15:30:39	@J	now, I'm not actually doing radial deadzones
2013-12-28 15:30:43	@J	can't really, because of the way it works
2013-12-28 15:31:02	@J	it's like the suggested method there, but everything is square instead
2013-12-28 15:31:07	Espyo	right
2013-12-28 15:31:15	@J	let me draw it
2013-12-28 15:33:03	@J	http://i.imgur.com/vzsIP6H.png
2013-12-28 15:33:06	@J	probably like that
2013-12-28 15:33:36	Espyo	right
2013-12-28 15:33:40	@J	though of course, you can only really think of it as 1-dimensional in the general case
2013-12-28 15:33:45	@J	I can't link axes together
2013-12-28 15:34:24	Espyo	yeah
2013-12-28 15:34:29	Espyo	other than that, the features make sense
2013-12-28 15:34:34	Espyo	but
2013-12-28 15:34:36	Espyo	- transformation system with automatic chaining
2013-12-28 15:34:42	Espyo	chaining? wouldn't that be nesting?
2013-12-28 15:36:04	@J	hmm
2013-12-28 15:36:15	@J	I thought so, but it doesn't sound right
2013-12-28 15:36:28	@J	I think nesting works too
2013-12-28 15:36:40	Espyo	well, if it's anything like OpenGL does, it's definitely nesting
2013-12-28 15:36:54	@J	what would you say is the difference?
2013-12-28 15:36:55	Espyo	you push a translation, push a rotation, then pop the rotation, then push a scale, ...
2013-12-28 15:37:10	@J	hmm
2013-12-28 15:37:14	Espyo	chaining looks more like transformation multiplication (uh... not exactly sure that's the word)
2013-12-28 15:37:21	Espyo	like, if you do a translation followed by a scale
2013-12-28 15:37:26	Espyo	I guess that's what I'd assume a chain to be
2013-12-28 15:37:52	@J	how it works is that transforms are _always_ applied, in a sense, they just do nothing by default
2013-12-28 15:37:53	Espyo	besides, it goes well to your previous usage of "nesting"
2013-12-28 15:38:00	@J	and they have a set order, so you can't do any more than once
2013-12-28 15:38:02	Espyo	well, that's how it is in reality
2013-12-28 15:38:13	Espyo	all defaults are an identity matrix transformation
2013-12-28 15:38:19	@J	so, if you rotate, then scale, it will scale and then rotate
2013-12-28 15:38:23	@J	because rotate comes last
2013-12-28 15:38:24	Espyo	 0x0 translation, 1x1 scale, 0 degree rotation
2013-12-28 15:38:24	Testyo	0 degree = 0 rad
2013-12-28 15:38:29	Espyo	exactly Testyo
2013-12-28 15:38:41	Espyo	so wait
2013-12-28 15:38:47	Espyo	you cannot rotate and then scale, at all?
2013-12-28 15:38:50	Espyo	only by "chaining"?
2013-12-28 15:38:50	@J	hmm
2013-12-28 15:38:56	@J	rotate is a special one
2013-12-28 15:39:28	@J	you can do everything else out of order, but because rotation moves the origin in a complex way, it's not really possible to place it before any other transform
2013-12-28 15:39:49	Espyo	I'm not really seeing how rotation would be special...
2013-12-28 15:40:07	@J	the issue is that all of this is bitmap stuff
2013-12-28 15:41:13	@J	hmm, I can't quite remember since I did it a while ago
2013-12-28 15:41:41	Espyo	heh
2013-12-28 15:47:57	@J	would you call that chaining, then?
2013-12-28 15:48:22	Espyo	"that"?
2013-12-28 15:48:31	@J	the thing I called chaining
2013-12-28 15:48:40	@J	'transformation system with automatic chaining'
2013-12-28 15:49:17	Espyo	uh...
2013-12-28 15:49:21	Espyo	what is "the thing", though?
2013-12-28 15:49:23	Espyo	we said quite a lot
2013-12-28 15:49:34	@J	how transforms work
2013-12-28 15:49:53	@J	I called it chaining, you said nesting made more sense
2013-12-28 15:50:14	Espyo	I don't think we even reached a conclusion
2013-12-28 15:50:28	Espyo	 15:37	Espyo	you push a translation, push a rotation, then pop the rotation, then push a scale, ...
2013-12-28 15:50:33	Espyo	if that's how it works, it's nesting
2013-12-28 15:51:05	@J	think of them like properties
2013-12-28 15:51:11	@J	img.angle = pi
2013-12-28 15:51:17	Espyo	right, right
2013-12-28 15:51:23	@J	img.scale_x = 2
2013-12-28 15:51:38	Espyo	(why not img.scale.x?)
2013-12-28 15:51:54	Espyo	(not that the PFE uses a "point" class either, but)
2013-12-28 15:52:15	@J	.scale_x is more of a convenience accessor for .scale
2013-12-28 15:52:20	Espyo	so you set those properties, and every time the screen is drawn, img suffers from those transformations?
2013-12-28 15:52:29	@J	there's .scale[0], .scale[1] or .scale_x, .scale_y
2013-12-28 15:52:31	Espyo	in the order translation, rotation, scale?
2013-12-28 15:52:35	Espyo	ah
2013-12-28 15:52:42	@J	translation doesn't really count as a transformation
2013-12-28 15:52:53	Espyo	sure, I can see that
2013-12-28 15:52:56	@J	because it doesn't change the image, just where it goes
2013-12-28 15:53:00	Espyo	right
2013-12-28 15:53:01	@J	_builtin_transforms = ('crop', 'flip', 'tint', 'resize', 'rotate')
2013-12-28 15:53:04	@J	that's the default order
2013-12-28 15:53:09	Espyo	it's /technically/ a transformation
2013-12-28 15:53:13	@J	yes
2013-12-28 15:53:14	Espyo	right
2013-12-28 15:53:21	Espyo	so that's what you consider chaining?
2013-12-28 15:53:23	@J	but not a thing handled by img.transform()
2013-12-28 15:53:30	@J	that's what I'm calling chaining here, yes
2013-12-28 15:53:35	Espyo	well, in that case
2013-12-28 15:53:41	Espyo	I think "combining" would be a better word
2013-12-28 15:54:11	@J	hmm
2013-12-28 15:54:24	@J	actually, what I really wanted to say when I wrote 'automatic chaining' is:
2013-12-28 15:54:46	@J	when you change a transform, it re-performs all successive transform
2013-12-28 15:54:58	Espyo	oh?
2013-12-28 15:55:13	--	Scr7`afk is now known as Scr7
2013-12-28 15:55:14	@J	so, if your image is cropped, resized and rotate, and you resize it, it will start from the cropped state and resize then rotate
2013-12-28 15:55:40	@J	if you do img.graphic = some_other_image, it will do all the transforms again
2013-12-28 15:56:03	Espyo	ah, I see now
2013-12-28 15:56:06	Espyo	hmm
2013-12-28 15:56:13	Espyo	well... I guess chaining would be the word then
2013-12-28 15:56:21	Espyo	but it's really not easy to understand what it is right away
2013-12-28 15:56:58	@J	'transformation system with automatic retransforming'?
2013-12-28 15:57:38	Espyo	yeah, maybe that would make more sense
2013-12-28 16:01:53	@J	did you have a suggestion for 'automatic input normalisation to avoid missing buttons that were pressed too early'?
2013-12-28 16:02:30	Espyo	uhm, I did think of something while I read it
2013-12-28 16:02:33	Espyo	but it's not quite the same
2013-12-28 16:02:40	Espyo	basically, "input buffering"
2013-12-28 16:02:45	Espyo	that's a thing in Super Smash Bros. Brawl
2013-12-28 16:02:56	Espyo	like, you can't punch while in mid-air
2013-12-28 16:02:59	Espyo	to punch, you press A
2013-12-28 16:03:13	Espyo	if you jump, and then press A four (I think) frames before touching the ground
2013-12-28 16:03:22	Espyo	it'll be saved in a buffer, and when you land, you punch
2013-12-28 16:03:31	@J	hmm
2013-12-28 16:03:31	Espyo	it's not quite the same concept, but it did remind me of it
2013-12-28 16:03:39	@J	seems too high-level for me to implement here
2013-12-28 16:03:56	@J	mm...
2013-12-28 16:03:57	Espyo	right, like I said, it's not the same thing
2013-12-28 16:04:04	Espyo	and it's a Brawl-only thing
2013-12-28 16:04:15	Espyo	I think it must've been made to battle the wifi delay issues
2013-12-28 16:04:40	@J	maybe there could be a thing like EventHandler.postpone(*events)
2013-12-28 16:05:02	@J	like .disable(), but to send them through when they're enabled again
2013-12-28 16:05:05	Espyo	http://www.ssbwiki.com/Buffer (more reading)
2013-12-28 16:05:16	@J	I've seen it in a few games, I think
2013-12-28 16:05:19	Espyo	hmm
2013-12-28 16:05:22	@J	though I can't remember any in particular
2013-12-28 16:06:03	Espyo	anyway, a name for your thing
2013-12-28 16:06:38	Espyo	"handling of premature input is considered normal"?
2013-12-28 16:06:39	Espyo	ugh
2013-12-28 16:08:39	@J	what
2013-12-28 16:09:15	@J	that sounds like an article title
2013-12-28 16:09:43	Espyo	haha
2013-12-28 16:12:38	Espyo	ok, Notepad++'s regex search can't do negation
2013-12-28 16:12:52	Espyo	\{f013\} 4 ^0 doesn't work
2013-12-28 16:12:59	Espyo	\{f013\} 4 1 does
2013-12-28 16:13:11	Espyo	you sure ^ isn't "start of line"?
2013-12-28 16:16:35	Espyo	ok, sublevels 2 and 3 of the Snagret Hole have 隠し床 set to 1
2013-12-28 16:17:03	Espyo	as does sublevel 1 of the Hole of Heroes
2013-12-28 16:17:36	Espyo	and sublevels 1 and 2 of the Dream Den
2013-12-28 16:18:12	Espyo	and finally a ton of sublevels in the Glutton's Kitchen
2013-12-28 16:19:01	Espyo	nice time for the wiki to die
2013-12-28 16:39:21	Espyo	ok, galleries for the template are a definite no
2013-12-28 16:39:28	Espyo	they don't even go inside templates, they're pushed out
2013-12-28 16:39:53	Espyo	...disregard that last part
2013-12-28 16:40:14	Espyo	either way, too much padding between them, description text is too big...
2013-12-28 17:40:35	@J	ech, got distracted
2013-12-28 17:40:39	@J	you need the '[]'
2013-12-28 17:40:46	@J	that's a character group
2013-12-28 17:41:08	@J	so, '[^aoeu]' means any character but 'a', 'o', 'e', 'u'
2013-12-28 17:41:19	@J	'[aoeu]' means 'a', 'o', 'e' or 'u'
2013-12-28 17:42:01	Espyo	oh
2013-12-28 17:42:27	Espyo	ah
2013-12-28 17:42:32	@J	https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Images#Mode_parameter
2013-12-28 17:42:35	Espyo	either way, the only values that exist for that parameter are 0 and 1
2013-12-28 17:42:39	@J	it's not available yet, but this looks interesting
2013-12-28 17:42:41	Espyo	do we have that mode?
2013-12-28 17:42:56	Espyo	do we have that "mode" feature, is what I meant
2013-12-28 17:43:06	@J	it's 1.22, we have 1.21.3
2013-12-28 17:43:10	@J	so no, not AT
2013-12-28 17:43:11	@J	M
2013-12-28 17:43:13	Espyo	doesn't help much, either way
2013-12-28 17:43:18	Espyo	for the infobox thing
2013-12-28 17:43:33	@J	packed looks like what you would want
2013-12-28 17:44:30	Espyo	you still can't set the background color
2013-12-28 17:44:34	Espyo	so they don't look all the same size
2013-12-28 17:44:48	Espyo	it was really jarring, specially with the long corridor, way2x2_snow
2013-12-28 17:44:59	Espyo	either way, I did it now
2013-12-28 17:45:02	Espyo	everything works just fine
2013-12-28 17:50:51	Espyo	great, wiki died again
2013-12-28 17:56:42	@J	wait, I'm not sure what your problem was
2013-12-28 17:56:57	@J	with the background colours
2013-12-28 17:57:21	@J	anyway, I've seen some wikis have templates which have numbered parameters like unit1, unit2, unit3, ...
2013-12-28 17:57:34	Espyo	oh
2013-12-28 17:57:38	@J	there's also a 'variables'/'loops' extension, but we don't have it
2013-12-28 17:57:42	Espyo	I was wondering about that
2013-12-28 17:57:48	Espyo	either way, I've got it settled now
2013-12-28 17:57:54	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/wiki/Loops_test
2013-12-28 17:57:58	@J	that's a test of that stuff
2013-12-28 17:58:27	@J	how did you do it?
2013-12-28 17:58:41	Espyo	let me just finish it and you'll see

2013-12-28 18:18:21	Espyo	Los_Plagas: it's done
2013-12-28 18:18:22	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Emergence_Cave&action=edit http://www.pikminwiki.com/Template:Sublevel_technical http://www.pikminwiki.com/Template:Sublevel_units
2013-12-28 18:18:41	Los_Plagas	Yay
2013-12-28 18:18:46	Los_Plagas	Oh, and I saw your edit.
2013-12-28 18:18:53	Los_Plagas	And it made me think.
2013-12-28 18:19:01	Los_Plagas	Can we call ourselves official at all?
2013-12-28 18:19:24	Los_Plagas	Nothing's really official unless Nintendo declares one of the wikis to be the right one.
2013-12-28 18:19:37	Espyo	that's right
2013-12-28 18:19:42	Espyo	that's part of why it requires more discussion
2013-12-28 18:19:59	Espyo	(also, working out, so I'll only be able to reply for like every other 2 minutes)
2013-12-28 18:21:12	Los_Plagas	We've been getting pretty serious about Wikia over here for a while, now. Do you think that (with more discussion) we might eventually email Nintendo and have them declare us the official one?
2013-12-28 18:21:27	Los_Plagas	Well, /ask/ them; they won't just automatically email back and say yes.
2013-12-28 18:22:29	Los_Plagas	If we don't, if they eventually choose one wiki to be official, they'll probably choose the Wikia one; Wikia has a /huge/ reputation, and plus it shows up first in Google.
2013-12-28 18:24:51	Espyo	absolutely not
2013-12-28 18:24:54	Espyo	for a few reasons
2013-12-28 18:25:07	Espyo	first, even though Nintendo used to be fine about fan content, they're going /berserk/ lately
2013-12-28 18:25:23	Espyo	if we even bring our wiki to their attention, they might decide that we're small time, and shut us down
2013-12-28 18:25:25	Espyo	just because they can
2013-12-28 18:25:44	Espyo	not to mention that our latest edits happen to include content ripped directly from in-game files
2013-12-28 18:25:48	Espyo	and they're kinda negative on hacking
2013-12-28 18:26:09	Espyo	of course they know fan wikis exist, I mean, if they don't know about the likes of Bulbapedia yet, then something's VERY seriously wrong
2013-12-28 18:26:26	Espyo	but that doesn't mean they won't shut someone down just because they can
2013-12-28 18:26:32	Espyo	specially, like I said, small guys like us
2013-12-28 18:26:41	Espyo	secondly, they just acknowledge fans as doing fan stuff
2013-12-28 18:26:51	Espyo	they don't care that this group is more dedicated or not
2013-12-28 18:27:02	Espyo	so they'll see both, disregard the content, and just notice that wikia has more people
2013-12-28 18:27:05	Espyo	and hence, is better
2013-12-28 18:27:16	Espyo	increases the chances of, if anything, Pikipedia being shunned
2013-12-28 18:27:46	Espyo	thirdly, if they realize what wikia is all about, they might decide to contact wikia staff and force them to change ads, in order to include, for instance, ads to Pikmin merchandise
2013-12-28 18:27:53	Espyo	making wikia Nintendo's favorite
2013-12-28 18:28:04	Espyo	so as you can see, there are several reasons to not contact them
2013-12-28 18:28:14	Los_Plagas	Yes, so like I was saying, Wikia will always be "the best" in public eyes.
2013-12-28 18:28:22	Espyo	and also, I really doubt they'll ever choose any wiki to be official
2013-12-28 18:28:33	Espyo	not even the Carmageddon staff sees my wiki as official
2013-12-28 18:28:36	Espyo	and they're really awesome people
2013-12-28 18:28:52	Espyo	almost the opposite of Nintendo, in terms of copyright claims and whatnot
2013-12-28 18:29:02	Espyo	so companies really don't do "official" wikis
2013-12-28 18:29:27	Los_Plagas	Which brings us back to my point.
2013-12-28 18:29:28	Los_Plagas	Anyway
2013-12-28 18:29:47	Los_Plagas	Could you imagine any hypothetical way we could call ourselves official
2013-12-28 18:30:02	Los_Plagas	And I really don't want to call us official unless we /are/ official.
2013-12-28 18:31:42	Espyo	right
2013-12-28 18:31:47	Espyo	the thing is, "official" is such a buzzword
2013-12-28 18:31:58	Espyo	we're "official" in the sense that we are the official WIKI
2013-12-28 18:32:10	Espyo	whereas the one hosted on wikia is not the REAL one
2013-12-28 18:32:12	Espyo	we are
2013-12-28 18:32:21	Espyo	but we're not "official" in the sense that we are endorsed by Nintendo
2013-12-28 18:32:29	Espyo	so there must be another word that isn't "official"
2013-12-28 18:32:32	Espyo	in addition, there's another problem
2013-12-28 18:32:40	Espyo	we do NOT want to point out any comparison to wikia
2013-12-28 18:32:46	Espyo	because we do NOT want to mention wikia
2013-12-28 18:32:55	Los_Plagas	<we
2013-12-28 18:33:06	Espyo	we want to have something that objectively states we're the real deal, and all others are fake
2013-12-28 18:33:13	Los_Plagas	<we're officia; in the sense that we are the official WIKI
2013-12-28 18:33:15	Espyo	without indicating specifically that there ARE any others
2013-12-28 18:33:18	Los_Plagas	How does this work?
2013-12-28 18:33:38	Los_Plagas	The Pikmin Wikia's community is MUCH larger than ours.
2013-12-28 18:33:50	Espyo	so?
2013-12-28 18:33:55	Los_Plagas	We can't say that the majority of users are over here, or than the main community of theirs decided to move.
2013-12-28 18:33:59	Espyo	we are the real wiki
2013-12-28 18:34:11	Espyo	the place over at wikia is an abandoned site, taken over by crazy people
2013-12-28 18:34:14	Espyo	we are the Pikmin wiki
2013-12-28 18:34:20	Espyo	they are some old place that shouldn't exist
2013-12-28 18:34:41	Los_Plagas	Without official endorsement, wouldn't the official wiki usually be
2013-12-28 18:34:47	Los_Plagas	1. The oldest place
2013-12-28 18:34:54	Los_Plagas	2. The one with the largest userbase
2013-12-28 18:35:06	Los_Plagas	All of these Wikia satisfies.
2013-12-28 18:35:13	Los_Plagas	Wikia, like you said, is old
2013-12-28 18:35:33	Los_Plagas	And bad
2013-12-28 18:35:51	Los_Plagas	But people don't really /care/, as evidenced by the fact that it's still up and running
2013-12-28 18:35:53	Los_Plagas	Also
2013-12-28 18:36:10	Los_Plagas	3. Wikia has more /official/ content, such as Pikmin 3 enemies and storyline and stuff
2013-12-28 18:36:29	Los_Plagas	We're still getting that stuff up and running, but right now our priority is, like you said, /hacked/ content.
2013-12-28 18:36:44	Espyo	I just said, we are official in the sense that we're the real deal
2013-12-28 18:36:49	Espyo	not in the sense that we're endorsed by Nintendo
2013-12-28 18:37:02	Espyo	the userbase does not have anything to do with the matter
2013-12-28 18:37:06	Espyo	and we are the oldest
2013-12-28 18:37:11	Espyo	me, GP, PikFan, OUR content
2013-12-28 18:37:17	Espyo	it all started all those years ago
2013-12-28 18:37:30	Espyo	all the content and users came to Pikipedia
2013-12-28 18:37:37	Espyo	leaving wikia in the dust
2013-12-28 18:37:50	Espyo	as for wikia having more content, never mind that
2013-12-28 18:37:53	Espyo	that'll be fixed soon
2013-12-28 18:38:21	Los_Plagas	I suppose.
2013-12-28 18:39:08	Espyo	we need to point out on the main page that Pikipedia is the real Pikmin wiki
2013-12-28 18:39:21	Espyo	all others are dumps that should've been abandoned
2013-12-28 18:39:34	Espyo	but we mustn't specifically address their existence either
2013-12-28 18:39:56	Los_Plagas	Also, is there any way we can do some SEO for our wiki>
2013-12-28 18:40:17	Los_Plagas	Because Google is almost always going to be the way we're found
2013-12-28 18:42:36	Espyo	SEO?
2013-12-28 18:42:40	Espyo	search engine...
2013-12-28 18:42:42	Espyo	overdrive?
2013-12-28 18:42:48	Los_Plagas	Optomization.
2013-12-28 18:43:12	Los_Plagas	*Optimization
2013-12-28 18:43:35	Los_Plagas	Basically a term for getting our wiki to number one on Google.
2013-12-28 18:43:50	@J	wouldn't it be better if the whole template title were the tt, not some ? on the ed?
2013-12-28 18:43:52	@J	*end
2013-12-28 18:46:18	Espyo	huh
2013-12-28 18:46:38	Espyo	also, Los_Plagas: our best bet right now is to be linked to, instead of searched
2013-12-28 18:47:17	Los_Plagas	Linking actually /helps/ with that
2013-12-28 18:47:23	Espyo	oh, I see what you mean now @J
2013-12-28 18:47:33	Espyo	try it, let's see how it looks
2013-12-28 18:47:42	Espyo	yes, linking helps with stuff like Google
2013-12-28 18:47:46	@J	Espyo: http://ikn.org.uk/Game_engine - did I miss anything?
2013-12-28 18:47:48	Espyo	but besides Google bombing, there's not much we can do
2013-12-28 18:48:02	Espyo	seriously, the only thing we can hope for is that our wiki becomes so high quality that we over take wikia
2013-12-28 18:48:05	@J	Espyo: template looks better
2013-12-28 18:48:07	Espyo	or alternately, wikia poots and died
2013-12-28 18:48:15	@J	stops the [show] overlapping the text, too
2013-12-28 18:48:23	Los_Plagas	I think the first option is slightly better.
2013-12-28 18:48:30	Los_Plagas	Plus it has more of a chance of happening.
2013-12-28 18:48:47	@J	poots?
2013-12-28 18:48:58	Espyo	farts
2013-12-28 18:49:14	Espyo	huh? the [show] doesn't overlap on my end
2013-12-28 18:49:17	@J	hmm
2013-12-28 18:49:31	@J	wait, it doesn't, but it gets too close
2013-12-28 18:51:48	Espyo	well, fine by me, make it the whole tile
2013-12-28 18:51:58	Espyo	yeah, it'd be better for people to come to us because we're better
2013-12-28 18:51:59	@J	tile?
2013-12-28 18:52:13	Espyo	unfortunately, it's mostly a popularity contest...
2013-12-28 18:52:16	Espyo	as with most things in life
2013-12-28 18:52:21	Espyo	oops, *title
2013-12-28 18:53:48	Espyo	J: maybe starting by pointing out the general features
2013-12-28 18:53:59	Espyo	like "works for 2D games, either side view, or top view"
2013-12-28 18:54:07	Espyo	and only after, specifying the technical features
2013-12-28 18:54:22	@J	ah
2013-12-28 18:54:35	@J	I suppose I'm assuming knowledge of Pygame
2013-12-28 18:54:45	@J	...which I didn't even mention
2013-12-28 18:54:48	Espyo	haha
2013-12-28 18:54:49	Espyo	yeah
2013-12-28 18:56:36	@J	okay, done
2013-12-28 18:56:45	@J	...except the link goes nowhere
2013-12-28 18:57:06	@J	now it does
2013-12-28 18:57:18	Espyo	heh, that's right, it doesn— didn't
2013-12-28 18:59:02	Los_Plagas	Wasn't there a Pikipedia Facebook page . . . ?
2013-12-28 18:59:04	Los_Plagas	I don't recall.
2013-12-28 18:59:19	Los_Plagas	Who owns that thing (if it does exist), anyway?
2013-12-28 18:59:26	Espyo	don't think there is one, no
2013-12-28 18:59:30	Espyo	though that'd be a nice idea

2013-12-28 19:01:12	Los_Plagas	Found it.
2013-12-28 19:03:04	Espyo	youch
2013-12-28 19:03:10	Espyo	last update last year
2013-12-28 19:03:16	Espyo	well, I use Facebook daily
2013-12-28 19:03:20	Espyo	once a day, really, not much more than that
2013-12-28 19:03:26	Espyo	but I wouldn't mind being an admin there
2013-12-28 19:03:29	Espyo	there's tons to talk about
2013-12-28 19:03:33	Espyo	random fun fact
2013-12-28 19:03:35	Espyo	*facts
2013-12-28 19:03:44	Espyo	activity on the wiki, which is only going to increase in the near future
2013-12-28 19:03:53	Espyo	in fact, there's something noteworthy right now
2013-12-28 19:03:56	Espyo	the project I'm doing
2013-12-28 19:04:32	<--	Testyo (Testyo@l24-248-52-895.cpe.netcabo.pt) has quit (Quit: So long everyone!)
2013-12-28 19:04:35	Los_Plagas	Did you know about this before I mentioned it? Because I'm not sure it endorsed by /us/ . . . 
2013-12-28 19:04:41	<--	BetaMaster (BetaMaster@c-521-44-23-901.hsd6.pa.comcast.net) has quit (Killed (NickServ (GHOST command used by AirMario)))
2013-12-28 19:04:47	Los_Plagas	Still, it could be useful if we found whoever owns it 
2013-12-28 19:05:01	-->	Testyo (Testyo@l24-248-52-895.cpe.netcabo.pt) has joined #pikipedia
2013-12-28 19:05:01	Testyo	Hi everyone!
2013-12-28 19:05:04	Los_Plagas	And asks them to update it with the stuff we've been doing.
2013-12-28 19:05:11	Espyo	could be Porple
2013-12-28 19:05:13	Espyo	or Prez
2013-12-28 19:05:26	Los_Plagas	Testyo . . . ?

2013-12-28 19:05:33	Los_Plagas	Anyway, it could be them.
2013-12-28 19:05:51	Espyo	I glitched Testyo, had to restart him
2013-12-28 19:06:54	Espyo	specifically, if he's kicked and then I tell him to rejoin, he'll think he's already on the channel he was kicked out of
2013-12-28 19:06:59	Espyo	chat-wise, Testyo works fine
2013-12-28 19:07:02	Espyo	but internally, he's just a mess...
2013-12-28 19:07:58	Los_Plagas	If I ever managed to program something, as long as it worked fine I wouldn't care how neat it was
2013-12-28 19:08:00	Los_Plagas	Until I updated it.
2013-12-28 19:08:34	Espyo	exactly
2013-12-28 19:08:37	Espyo	that's the problem
2013-12-28 19:08:43	Espyo	recently, I made him not join a channel if he's already there
2013-12-28 19:08:47	Espyo	aaaaaand that resulted in this glitch
2013-12-28 19:11:34	Los_Plagas	You think the Facebook page could help us at all?
2013-12-28 19:11:48	Espyo	if we gather fans, yeah
2013-12-28 19:14:21	Los_Plagas	Wikia doesn't have one.
2013-12-28 19:14:38	Los_Plagas	The secret to social media . . .
2013-12-28 19:14:58	Los_Plagas	Now that I think of it, Wikia's basically a social media in itself . . .
2013-12-28 19:15:07	Los_Plagas	*social media site
2013-12-28 19:16:48	Espyo	mhm
2013-12-28 19:16:55	Espyo	in fact, wikia is trying to become facebook
2013-12-28 19:17:00	Espyo	how pathetic
2013-12-28 19:17:11	Espyo	everyone's trying to be facebook now, regardless of the damage that causes
2013-12-28 19:17:19	Espyo	wikia tried to focus more on being social, and less on content
2013-12-28 19:17:27	Espyo	result = it's hated by people who genuinely care about wikis
2013-12-28 19:17:35	Espyo	youtube tried to focus more on being social, and less on users
2013-12-28 19:17:44	Espyo	result = it's broken to bits and now everybody hates G+ more than ever
2013-12-28 19:20:18	Los_Plagas	If G+ hadn't done that, Bob and his army of tanks probably wouldn't be showing up nearly so much.
2013-12-28 19:20:55	Espyo	yeah
2013-12-28 19:21:25	@J	[18:59:19] Los_Plagas Who owns that thing (if it does exist), anyway?
2013-12-28 19:21:26	Los_Plagas	Hmmm
2013-12-28 19:21:30	@J	I would guess Porple
2013-12-28 19:21:53	Los_Plagas	Maybe we could turn "Bob" against Wikia . . .
2013-12-28 19:21:56	Espyo	Testyo: memo Prez would you happen to know who owns the Pikipedia Facebook page? https://www.facebook.com/pages/Pikipedia/171251012917698
2013-12-28 19:21:57	Testyo	Done. I saved a memo for Prez saying: would you happen to know who owns the Pikipedia Facebook page? https://www.facebook.com/pages/Pikipedia/171251012917698.
2013-12-28 19:22:10	Espyo	does he log in as "Prez", or "Prezintenden"?
2013-12-28 19:22:18	Los_Plagas	Does Prez usually use the alias of "Prez," or Prezintenden--
2013-12-28 19:22:18	@J	varies
2013-12-28 19:22:25	Espyo	heh
2013-12-28 19:22:27	Espyo	hmm
2013-12-28 19:22:31	Los_Plagas	Should probably memo "Prezintenden" too.
2013-12-28 19:22:32	@J	but that was created since he became inactive, I think
2013-12-28 19:22:35	Espyo	Testyo: Prezintenden is an alias of Prez
2013-12-28 19:22:35	Testyo	Done. Now I know that the nickname Prezintenden is an alias of Prez.
2013-12-28 19:22:36	@J	so I doubt he knows anything
2013-12-28 19:22:42	Espyo	still worth a try
2013-12-28 19:22:58	Los_Plagas	Does Porple typically go on the IRC?
2013-12-28 19:23:45	@J	no
2013-12-28 19:23:56	@J	he only really does hosting; he's more involved in MarioWiki
2013-12-28 19:24:08	@J	but he replies quickly to stuff on his talk page
2013-12-28 19:27:20	Los_Plagas	That page was pretty weak.
2013-12-28 19:27:35	Los_Plagas	Do you think it would be better to start a new one as a Facebook /group/?
2013-12-28 19:28:01	Los_Plagas	After all, we are a community, so a group would express that better than a page.
2013-12-28 19:28:05	Espyo	hmm
2013-12-28 19:28:15	Espyo	but I'm probably the only one who actually has a Facebook page, out of all Pikipedians
2013-12-28 19:28:50	Espyo	I'd rather keep that page
2013-12-28 19:28:55	Espyo	we could keep the Likes

2013-12-28 19:29:28	Los_Plagas	We don't have too many users anyway.
2013-12-28 19:30:50	Espyo	exactly
2013-12-28 19:31:33	Los_Plagas	What's the kind of stuff you'd be planning to ask whoever owns it to post, anyway?
2013-12-28 19:31:43	Los_Plagas	Announcements for important things?
2013-12-28 19:32:57	Espyo	ownership
2013-12-28 19:33:03	Espyo	it's clear the person in charge is bored with it already
2013-12-28 19:33:09	Espyo	so they probably wouldn't mind shifting ownership
2013-12-28 19:33:17	Espyo	or at least shared ownership
2013-12-28 19:34:02	Los_Plagas	Does Facebook have a way to do that?

2013-12-28 19:36:49	Los_Plagas	As in, it's not Porple (or Prez)

2013-12-28 19:37:06	@J	hmm
2013-12-28 19:37:09	Los_Plagas	Are we going to try to contact them via Facebook, give up the idea, or start another page?
2013-12-28 19:37:15	@J	maybe the same guy did it
2013-12-28 19:37:26	@J	in which case, chances of contacting him are low
2013-12-28 19:37:50	Los_Plagas	. . . It has the exact same posts as the Facebook page.
2013-12-28 19:37:59	Los_Plagas	I'd wager it's the same guy.
2013-12-28 19:38:07	@J	yeah, and 'Joined Facebook

2013-12-28 19:38:14	Los_Plagas	It's Revan!
2013-12-28 19:38:23	@J	mhm
2013-12-28 19:38:31	Los_Plagas	Very bottom: "Welcome to Pikipedia Twitter. The founder, Revan . . ."
2013-12-28 19:38:34	@J	he came back for a little while a couple of years ago
2013-12-28 19:38:42	@J	did some things
2013-12-28 19:38:45	@J	then vanished again
2013-12-28 19:38:59	Los_Plagas	Oh, Dark Lord Revan . . .
2013-12-28 19:40:14	Los_Plagas	According to him, "even if I'm not that active [. . .] I still care about this wiki. I don't wanna lose my baby."
2013-12-28 19:40:23	Los_Plagas	He might still occasionally check this place.
2013-12-28 19:40:34	Los_Plagas	If we message his talk-page, he might see the notification.
2013-12-28 19:41:17	Espyo	drat
2013-12-28 19:41:26	Espyo	yeah
2013-12-28 19:41:31	Espyo	guess we'll have to use his talk page
2013-12-28 19:41:59	Los_Plagas	Calling the wiki "his baby" seems to suggest that he really does care.
2013-12-28 19:42:20	Los_Plagas	But I suppose that's how a lot of people feel about their new dog up until they give it to the pound.
2013-12-28 19:45:16	Espyo	yeah...
2013-12-28 19:47:35	Los_Plagas	I have a (little-used) Twitter. His little thing is pretty inactive, but I could message the Pikipedia account if you think it could help.
2013-12-28 19:50:13	Espyo	it would help, thanks
2013-12-28 19:50:27	Espyo	he should at least be notified, even if he doesn't use it ofte
2013-12-28 19:50:29	Espyo	*n
2013-12-28 19:52:07	Los_Plagas	Are you looking to take over the Twitter account, too?
2013-12-28 19:54:34	Espyo	no, I don't use twitter
2013-12-28 19:54:39	Espyo	also "take over" is so harsh...
2013-12-28 19:54:44	Espyo	I'm just giving it new life
2013-12-28 19:55:37	Los_Plagas	It's basically what you're doing with the Facebook.
2013-12-28 19:55:49	Los_Plagas	Take over doesn't have to be all military or anything.
2013-12-28 19:55:53	Espyo	hehe
2013-12-28 19:55:55	Espyo	I suppose
2013-12-28 19:56:14	Los_Plagas	Think about it as taking over a position at a job because the last person quit.
2013-12-28 20:00:08	Los_Plagas	If Revan doesn't respond, are you going to give up or make an entirely new page for the wiki?
2013-12-28 20:00:22	Espyo	give up
2013-12-28 20:00:39	Espyo	it hasn't been important so far, it's not going to start now unless everything points in that direction
2013-12-28 20:02:41	Los_Plagas	If he does pass it on to you, though, do you think it'll actually help attract people to the wiki?
2013-12-28 20:04:01	Espyo	thanks for actually complaining that I sent you a boolean when you wanted a string, C++
2013-12-28 20:04:11	Espyo	that certainly didn't cause you to crash with a not-really-descriptive error
2013-12-28 20:04:14	Espyo	sigh
2013-12-28 20:04:19	Espyo	Los_Plagas: it might
2013-12-28 20:04:21	Espyo	only time will tell
2013-12-28 20:05:19	Los_Plagas	To be honest, I think we're probably the first people to actually look at the page in probably /months/.
2013-12-28 20:08:06	Espyo	mhm
2013-12-28 20:08:14	Espyo	then again, nobody checks updates by going to the page
2013-12-28 20:08:28	Espyo	when somebody likes a page, they get new updates on their main Facebook page
2013-12-28 20:09:37	Los_Plagas	So about 22 people get nonexistent updates, assuming they didn't uncheck the "Follow" button when they liked it.
2013-12-28 20:10:38	Espyo	right
2013-12-28 20:15:25	Los_Plagas	And I doubt anybody was really interested in it anyway.
2013-12-28 20:15:45	Espyo	who knows
2013-12-28 20:15:53	Espyo	maybe they'll be more interested once I start giving better updates
2013-12-28 20:24:14	Los_Plagas	Perhaps.
2013-12-28 20:24:38	Los_Plagas	What kind of "better updates" are you planning to post, anyway?
2013-12-28 20:28:42	Espyo	random fun facts
2013-12-28 20:28:47	Espyo	updates on changes to the wiki
2013-12-28 20:28:55	Espyo	updates on Pikmin 3 DLC and the like
2013-12-28 20:29:11	Los_Plagas	All those sound good.
2013-12-28 20:29:25	Los_Plagas	But give me an example of a "fun fact."
2013-12-28 20:29:50	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:Did_you_know&action=edit
2013-12-28 20:30:24	Los_Plagas	Ah, the "Did You Know" facts.
2013-12-28 20:30:39	Los_Plagas	Do you think we should update those?
2013-12-28 20:32:29	Espyo	I added one yesterday (or so)
2013-12-28 20:35:31	Los_Plagas	I think we've kind of exhausted the social media topic. I think we should probably move on.
2013-12-28 20:35:55	Los_Plagas	Did Pikfan give you any word on when he'd get back from his "hiatus"? I haven't seen him on chat for /ages/.
2013-12-28 20:38:07	Espyo	he pops up at times on IRC

2013-12-28 20:39:22	Los_Plagas	Meep
2013-12-28 20:39:29	Los_Plagas	According to his page on Pikmin Fanon
2013-12-28 20:39:46	Los_Plagas	He's losing interest in Pikmin Fanon Wiki.
2013-12-28 20:39:52	Espyo	hm
2013-12-28 20:39:55	Los_Plagas	I hope that doesn't apply for the whole Pikmin franchise.
2013-12-28 20:40:05	Espyo	no, he's always eager to help on Pikipedia
2013-12-28 20:42:41	Los_Plagas	"Status: Okay, so I'm popping in and out, still not nearly as active as I once was. I have full access to the computer now, but... I don't know, it's like I'm losing interest in Pikmin Fanon, as sad as I am to say it... Maybe the inactivity here has taken its toll on me. But don't worry, I'm not going to disappear forever!

2013-12-28 20:43:11	Espyo	hm
2013-12-28 20:44:57	Los_Plagas	"hm" indeed.
2013-12-28 20:49:29	Los_Plagas	Anyway, at least that means his hiatus is over, so if he feels up to it, he'll be able to edit Pikipedia when he wants/
2013-12-28 20:51:31	Espyo	yep
2013-12-28 20:54:40	Los_Plagas	I'm curious about this

2013-12-28 20:57:14	Los_Plagas	I sense another easter-egg in the making.
2013-12-28 20:59:47	Espyo	mhm
2013-12-28 21:00:27	Los_Plagas	I'll tell everyone on the channel about it!
2013-12-28 21:00:28	Los_Plagas	. . .
2013-12-28 21:00:42	Los_Plagas	So basically, J and I will know about it.

2013-12-28 21:00:53	Espyo	there's still #Testyo
2013-12-28 21:01:19	Los_Plagas	I suppose.
2013-12-28 21:01:33	@J	I last saw JJ 19th December 2012
2013-12-28 21:01:45	Los_Plagas	Do you think it's kind of sad that more people go on Testyo's channel than the Pikipedia channel?
2013-12-28 21:02:08	Los_Plagas	@J: yeah, his very last edit was, I think, right before Christmas; something about my edit to the glitches page . . .
2013-12-28 21:02:27	@J	[21:01:45] Los_Plagas Do you think it's kind of sad that more people go on Testyo's channel than thePikipedia channel?
2013-12-28 21:02:30	@J	they do?
2013-12-28 21:02:40	Los_Plagas	Not all at once
2013-12-28 21:02:58	Los_Plagas	But all the users of the Pikipedia channel go there 
2013-12-28 21:03:09	Los_Plagas	And there are also people who don't go here either.
2013-12-28 21:03:38	Los_Plagas	So it's simple: #pikipedia = us, #Testyo = us + other random people.
2013-12-28 21:03:51	@J	conclusion: Testyo > Pikipedia?
2013-12-28 21:04:04	Espyo	yeah
2013-12-28 21:04:11	Espyo	well, people from all around the network go on #Testyo
2013-12-28 21:04:41	Los_Plagas	Yes, that's basically it.
2013-12-28 21:06:47	Los_Plagas	@J: yesterday, Espyo mentioned that he and you were still working behind the scenes with the issue of Pikipedia's background image. Any progress?

2013-12-28 21:20:25	Espyo	yeah?
2013-12-28 21:20:41	Los_Plagas	Do you think that, in the future, Testyo could become smarter, conversation-wise?
2013-12-28 21:21:13	Los_Plagas	Kind of like ALICE in the sense that he's able to reply to simple questions in the manner a human would.
2013-12-28 21:22:09	Espyo	heh, not likely
2013-12-28 21:23:44	Los_Plagas	Because the Cleverbot-esque way he replies now isn't really realistic, as we don't focus on the kinds of things a human making small talk with Cleverbot would.
2013-12-28 21:24:52	Espyo	yeah
2013-12-28 21:24:59	Espyo	not to mention Testyo is filled with other stuff
2013-12-28 21:25:05	Espyo	adding smartness on top of that...
2013-12-28 21:32:41	@J	his intelligence is less surprising if it happens by chance, right?
2013-12-28 21:33:10	Espyo	yeah
2013-12-28 21:33:20	@J	*more
2013-12-28 21:33:24	@J	more surprising
2013-12-28 21:34:26	@J	http://ikn.org.uk/ minor redesign; anything obviously gone wrong?
2013-12-28 21:35:00	@J	if you search and get no results, the footer overlaps the sidebar badly; not sure how to fix that
2013-12-28 21:36:09	<--	Testyo (Testyo@l24-248-52-895.cpe.netcabo.pt) has quit (Quit: Later everyone!)
2013-12-28 21:37:48	Los_Plagas	The issue happens on the "About" page, too.
2013-12-28 21:38:04	@J	ah, yes
2013-12-28 21:38:08	@J	not so badly, though
2013-12-28 21:38:35	Los_Plagas	I think it happens on pages that are really short.
2013-12-28 21:38:46	Espyo	right, I read it as "more surprising"
2013-12-28 21:38:47	Los_Plagas	Should be pretty obvious, but the longer a page is, the more it's pushed down.
2013-12-28 21:39:16	@J	yep
2013-12-28 21:39:16	Los_Plagas	<J>: his intelligence is less surprising if it happens by chance, right?
2013-12-28 21:39:19	Los_Plagas	Well, no
2013-12-28 21:39:23	Los_Plagas	Because it's not really intelligence
2013-12-28 21:39:56	Los_Plagas	It's charming to see him respond in a way that simulates intelligence, but it wouldn't be /actual/ intelligence unless it would've happened under any circumstance.

2013-12-28 21:43:54	Testyo	Hi everyone!
2013-12-28 21:43:56	@J	I could hack it by having an invisible box floated left with a great enough height and then clear:left on the footer
2013-12-28 21:44:09	@J	I would feel pretty bad, though
2013-12-28 21:44:26	Los_Plagas	I suppose you could
2013-12-28 21:44:39	Los_Plagas	But wouldn't you have to redo the process for every page?
2013-12-28 21:44:48	Los_Plagas	(And feel bad about it for every page)
2013-12-28 21:45:15	Los_Plagas	And if there's a lot of pages with the issue (AKA short pages), than that might get a bit cumbersome.
2013-12-28 21:46:56	@J	no, it's templated
2013-12-28 21:47:10	@J	I would just have to edit one file
2013-12-28 21:51:21	@J	well, I did it
2013-12-28 21:51:23	@J	so ashamed
2013-12-28 21:52:48	Los_Plagas	There's no reason to be ashamed for it if there was no other way.
2013-12-28 21:53:02	Los_Plagas	Best solution: stick with this and /never ever/ see if there was really another way.
2013-12-28 22:03:29	Espyo	hacky hacky hacky
2013-12-28 22:03:35	Espyo	I'll make sure to point this down on your permanent record

2013-12-28 23:27:41	Los_Plagas	How could they get rid of that?
2013-12-28 23:27:51	Los_Plagas	That's like, signature Blue Pikmin.
2013-12-28 23:27:58	Los_Plagas	Besides breathing in water, of course.

2013-12-28 23:31:50	@PikFan	and also, if Pikmin bring something to the Onion/ship, and the active leader is nearby, they don't join the group
2013-12-28 23:32:04	@PikFan	they remain idle

2013-12-29 00:51:44	Los_Plagas	I'm sure he's having lots of fun . . . leaving pitiful me in the dust, without Wii U nor Pikmin 3 in sight. . . . 
2013-12-29 00:52:15	Los_Plagas	Ah, the joys of being young and being able to get almost anything as long as your parents say yes. . . .
2013-12-29 00:56:04	Espyo	heh
2013-12-29 00:56:05	Espyo	and me
2013-12-29 00:56:12	Espyo	no, the joys of having money
2013-12-29 00:56:49	Los_Plagas	The definition of money: something you lose once you no longer live with your parents.
2013-12-29 01:00:35	Los_Plagas	Definition 2. Something that can be used to buy Pikmin 3.
2013-12-29 01:00:59	Los_Plagas	Why couldn't Pikmin 3 be for the Wii?!
2013-12-29 01:01:12	Los_Plagas	Why do you have to buy a whole new console just for Pikmin 3?
2013-12-29 01:01:18	Espyo	yep
2013-12-29 01:01:23	Espyo	oh well
2013-12-29 01:01:26	Espyo	at least it's prettier
2013-12-29 01:02:22	Los_Plagas	And perhaps better. 
2013-12-29 01:02:28	Los_Plagas	Besides the Blue Pikmin issue.
2013-12-29 01:02:31	Los_Plagas	That was sad.
2013-12-29 01:02:49	Los_Plagas	I wonder if the Pikmin have better A.I. overall, though.
2013-12-29 01:02:59	Los_Plagas	It would be nice to see some Pikmin that could work by themselves.
2013-12-29 01:04:36	Espyo	yeah...
2013-12-29 01:05:20	Espyo	they can go back once they grab a piece of bridge, though
2013-12-29 01:05:21	Espyo	and grab another
2013-12-29 01:05:41	Los_Plagas	Well, they're specifically scripted to do that
2013-12-29 01:06:15	Los_Plagas	A true A.I. would be able to do something without the game necessarily forcing it to do so, just giving it some pointers and letting the A.I. do the rest.
2013-12-29 01:06:39	Espyo	yeah
2013-12-29 01:06:49	Espyo	then again, the whole point of the game is you finding the time to micro-manage everything
2013-12-29 01:07:50	Los_Plagas	I saw a Japanese video of one of the boss fights, and I could've sworn the captains talked with real voice-acting . . . 
2013-12-29 01:07:52	Los_Plagas	Do they?
2013-12-29 01:08:11	Los_Plagas	Of course, if it was dialogue and not just gibberish, it was in Japanese?
2013-12-29 01:08:13	Los_Plagas	*.
2013-12-29 01:08:23	Los_Plagas	But I'd want to hear the English version of that.
2013-12-29 01:10:19	Espyo	I think it's Japanese gibberish
2013-12-29 01:10:28	Espyo	Japanese lines are the same as English ones
2013-12-29 01:10:31	Espyo	game version-wise
2013-12-29 01:12:16	Los_Plagas	That's too bad.
2013-12-29 01:12:30	Los_Plagas	I would love to see real voice-acting in a Pikmin game.
2013-12-29 01:12:50	Los_Plagas	But really, they're so great that voice-acting would just be one cherry on the figurative cake.
2013-12-29 01:15:00	Espyo	yeah
2013-12-29 01:15:07	Espyo	even simple stuff would be great
2013-12-29 01:18:02	Los_Plagas	But anyway, now we have /two/ people in our wiki with Pikmin 3.
2013-12-29 01:18:55	Los_Plagas	I think the only reason we're not up to speed on everything in Pikmin 3 is that our user base is so damn small. If none of us buy Pikmin 3, no new users going to suddenly sign up with the game.
2013-12-29 01:19:11	Los_Plagas	Unlike Wikia. 
2013-12-29 01:19:43	Los_Plagas	It's a shame that our main userbase consists of people who moved here from Wikia, not people who joined here because they wanted to contribute to a Pikmin information source.
2013-12-29 01:19:56	Los_Plagas	The latter usually goes to Wikia, where their talents are wasted.
2013-12-29 01:20:20	Espyo	yeah
2013-12-29 01:22:24	Los_Plagas	Meh.
2013-12-29 01:22:32	Los_Plagas	Did you implement the new game into Testyo yet?
2013-12-29 01:23:03	Los_Plagas	If his code is really as messy as you say it is, I'd recommend tidying up the stuff that makes him run while you're there.
2013-12-29 01:23:44	Espyo	I did
2013-12-29 01:24:01	Espyo	the general internals are slightly messy
2013-12-29 01:24:05	Los_Plagas	The tidying up of code, the game, or both?
2013-12-29 01:24:14	Espyo	just general
2013-12-29 01:24:26	Espyo	but recently I worked on improving the way games work
2013-12-29 01:24:30	Espyo	so making games is super robust
2013-12-29 01:24:35	Espyo	anyway, the game IS done
2013-12-29 01:24:38	Espyo	I played 5 matches already
2013-12-29 01:24:39	Espyo	super fun
2013-12-29 01:24:47	Espyo	but I'll show it here tomorrow
2013-12-29 01:25:52	Espyo	gotta tweak one or two things
2013-12-29 01:25:56	Espyo	besides, I'm Brawling, so...
2013-12-29 01:26:59	Los_Plagas	Brawl . . . everyone keeps mentioning it; I'll have to pick it up sooner or later. . . .
2013-12-29 01:28:35	Espyo	well, you're better off waiting for Smash 4 now
2013-12-29 01:29:39	Los_Plagas	There's a good chance Smash 4 will be on the Wii U, in which case . . .
2013-12-29 01:37:39	Los_Plagas	That would be bad.
2013-12-29 01:37:48	Los_Plagas	As I'm probably not going to get the Wii U soon.
2013-12-29 01:38:16	Los_Plagas	In fact, I'll probably get the Wii U after a few more generations of the Wii.
2013-12-29 01:38:46	Los_Plagas	And when Pikmin 3 is old, Pikmin 2 is older, and I'll be able to sell my copy of Pikmin at an antique website.
2013-12-29 01:41:10	Espyo	I might get a Wii U soon
2013-12-29 01:42:00	Los_Plagas	That's great
2013-12-29 01:42:12	Los_Plagas	If you do, you can send me pictures and I'll pretend I'm in them.
2013-12-29 01:44:17	Los_Plagas	If you do, though, you'll be able to seriously help our Pikmin 3 stuff, so that's a plus.
2013-12-29 01:44:26	Los_Plagas	Maybe you'll even be able to hack it and get an inside look at the code.
2013-12-29 01:45:11	Los_Plagas	Of course, I'm assuming you'll get Pikmin 3, too.
2013-12-29 01:45:40	Espyo	heh
2013-12-29 01:45:54	Espyo	yeah, I'd put aside everything and dedicate myself on the wiki for a full two weeks
2013-12-29 01:46:34	Los_Plagas	Tell that to your professor. 
2013-12-29 01:47:04	Los_Plagas	"I promised Los_Plagas on the chat that I would dedicate myself to the wiki for two weeks, so that's why I'm missing two weeks' worth of assignments!"
2013-12-29 01:50:17	Los_Plagas	Best excuse ever.
2013-12-29 01:51:09	Espyo	hehe
2013-12-29 01:51:15	Espyo	I only have one week of classes left
2013-12-29 01:51:18	Espyo	...hopefully /forever/
2013-12-29 01:51:24	Espyo	well, one week + finals
2013-12-29 01:51:45	Los_Plagas	Forever?! As in . . .  done with college?
2013-12-29 01:52:50	Espyo	forever, yes
2013-12-29 01:52:50	Espyo	I only have 3 more subjects
2013-12-29 01:52:50	Espyo	and they might end soon
2013-12-29 01:52:50	Espyo	if I pass them all
2013-12-29 01:52:52	Espyo	but these are the last 3 that got left behind
2013-12-29 01:52:56	Espyo	and they got left behind for a reason
2013-12-29 01:53:13	Espyo	I still couldn't finish them
2013-12-29 02:07:47	Los_Plagas	Woah
2013-12-29 02:07:54	Los_Plagas	I still have a long time to go before /that/
2013-12-29 02:09:10	Espyo	good luck
2013-12-29 02:10:02	Los_Plagas	Thanks for that
2013-12-29 02:10:06	Los_Plagas	But hopefully I won't need it.
2013-12-29 02:10:12	Los_Plagas	Good luck on your upcoming finals.
2013-12-29 02:12:31	Los_Plagas	Well, actually, I'll be done with college soon as well.
2013-12-29 02:12:44	Los_Plagas	I won't be done with my /schooling/ for a while though.
2013-12-29 02:14:11	Los_Plagas	So if you're talking about /just/ college, then yeah, I'll be done soon. But as for other forms of learning, such as medical school for instance, then . . . yeah,
2013-12-29 02:17:42	Espyo	thanks
2013-12-29 02:17:50	Espyo	I was talking about everything
2013-12-29 02:17:54	Espyo	I won't be taking a master's degree
2013-12-29 02:17:59	Espyo	I'm through with all of this
2013-12-29 02:20:09	Los_Plagas	I wish it was that easy for the career path I'm choosing.
2013-12-29 02:21:35	Espyo	what area are you on?
2013-12-29 02:24:38	Los_Plagas	Area? Does area = fute field of profession? If you're talking about what I think you're talking about, my area would be medical.
2013-12-29 02:24:45	Espyo	well, field
2013-12-29 02:24:48	Espyo	yeah, "medical"
2013-12-29 02:24:56	Espyo	uh, education terms are really hard to translate
2013-12-29 02:27:38	Los_Plagas	Yeah, I know. Anyway, let's just treat the term "area" as a general synonym for "field.

2013-12-29 02:27:59	Los_Plagas	Mind telling me your particular area?
2013-12-29 02:28:25	Espyo	computer engineerin
2013-12-29 02:28:30	Espyo	*engineering
2013-12-29 02:29:03	Los_Plagas	I suppose your work with Testyo and the game engine should support that.
2013-12-29 02:29:19	Espyo	yeah
2013-12-29 02:29:37	Espyo	though sadly, about 0% of what I learned in college was actually helpful in making those
2013-12-29 02:29:39	Espyo	rounded
2013-12-29 02:30:30	Los_Plagas	That could mean one of two things: 1. Your college isn't actually that good, or 2. Testyo and your engine weren't related to what you learned in class.
2013-12-29 02:30:58	Los_Plagas	Though I suppose those two exploits could be added to your resume for a job.
2013-12-29 02:32:39	Espyo	a little of both
2013-12-29 02:32:45	Espyo	the problem is they try to teach us a bit of everything
2013-12-29 02:32:56	Espyo	...which in turn makes us proficient at nothing
2013-12-29 02:33:59	Los_Plagas	Hmm
2013-12-29 02:34:40	Los_Plagas	Do you think that, if you didn't go to college, you wouldn't be as good at coding as you are now, even marginally; or do you think going to college was really only useful to get a reputation for job purposes?
2013-12-29 02:35:06	Espyo	the latter, really
2013-12-29 02:35:15	Espyo	I learned most of my coding skills in high school and by myself
2013-12-29 02:35:22	Espyo	that's another thing about college, as well
2013-12-29 02:35:26	Espyo	they teach us basic programming
2013-12-29 02:35:33	Espyo	which I already knew from high school
2013-12-29 02:35:37	Espyo	apparently they assume nobody knows
2013-12-29 02:35:45	Espyo	but then they also jump into advanced programming
2013-12-29 02:35:48	Espyo	it's kinda bizarre
2013-12-29 02:35:51	Espyo	poorly made
2013-12-29 02:36:21	Los_Plagas	At the same time, I feel kind of sorry for you and your education system yet also want to be you.
2013-12-29 02:36:42	Los_Plagas	After all, it's easier to find instructions on how to code online than to find instructions on how to perform advanced surgical procedures.
2013-12-29 02:36:42	Espyo	medical must be worse
2013-12-29 02:36:50	Espyo	computer is close second, though
2013-12-29 02:36:53	Espyo	having to learn /physics/
2013-12-29 02:37:23	Espyo	physics like heat transfer
2013-12-29 02:37:32	Espyo	not the good kind of physics, like the ones that would help me make games
2013-12-29 02:38:12	Los_Plagas	Heat transfer? Wouldn't that be used for actual computer /building/ rather than coding? Unless your course covers both.
2013-12-29 02:38:21	Espyo	exactly
2013-12-29 02:38:25	Espyo	and we learn 0% about computer building
2013-12-29 02:40:19	Los_Plagas	That's odd. Is there an option to continue into physical computer building once you're finished with this course? The only reason I can imagine for that is that they're teaching you the basics and expect you to learn more in the more specific advanced courses.
2013-12-29 02:40:54	Espyo	I'm not sure there is
2013-12-29 02:42:19	Los_Plagas	In that case, you're basically learning stuff you're never going to use in real-life.
2013-12-29 02:42:36	Espyo	yep
2013-12-29 02:42:37	Espyo	sad
2013-12-29 02:42:44	Espyo	and
2013-12-29 02:42:51	Espyo	unsurprisingly
2013-12-29 02:42:54	Los_Plagas	Not in the sense that you're just pretty sure you won't use it, but that you're seriously not going to use it because that's not what the course is for.
2013-12-29 02:42:58	Espyo	that's one of the subjects I'm stuck on
2013-12-29 02:43:04	Espyo	yeah, exactly
2013-12-29 02:43:45	Espyo	if they wanted to teach me it "just because", why didn't they teach me geography, or literature?
2013-12-29 02:45:09	Los_Plagas	I read this page: http://www.cambridge.org/us/engineering/author/nellisandklein/
2013-12-29 02:45:20	Los_Plagas	And still have no idea the point of learning heat engineering for coding.
2013-12-29 02:45:51	Los_Plagas	And it might be talking about physical engineering anyway.
2013-12-29 02:47:06	Espyo	no point whatsoever, really
2013-12-29 02:49:18	Los_Plagas	I didn't really think there would be.
2013-12-29 02:49:53	Espyo	yeah...
2013-12-29 02:50:14	Los_Plagas	Personally, I'd feel horrible if I was in your situation, because I'd be torn between leaving and getting a head-start because I'm not learning any of the good stuff, or stay just for the credentials.
2013-12-29 02:50:59	Espyo	that's exactly how I feel
2013-12-29 02:51:03	Los_Plagas	Because, I mean, I still really hope you have a great future, but I wouldn't expect you to get a job coding at Apple with just a Bachelor's Degree, unless you're literally the best programmer in the world/
2013-12-29 02:51:06	Espyo	well, not so much any more, because, hey, it's the last week
2013-12-29 02:51:10	Espyo	I won't stop now
2013-12-29 02:51:12	Espyo	but if I fail...
2013-12-29 02:51:17	Espyo	I'll seriously consider leaving
2013-12-29 02:52:11	Espyo	yeah, I won't hope to get too too far without a bachelor's either
2013-12-29 02:52:27	Espyo	I still hope to be big on a company that can qualify me based on my skills and achievements
2013-12-29 02:52:35	Espyo	and not because I passed bloody physics
2013-12-29 02:54:21	Los_Plagas	Unfortunately, most companies won't do that.
2013-12-29 02:55:22	Los_Plagas	And, let's face it, they're kind of right, because the only way to test your skill is to pay you for a while, and if you suck (which you don't, but some people do) they've lost money.
2013-12-29 02:55:45	Espyo	yeah
2013-12-29 02:59:29	Los_Plagas	I don't know about the computer engineering education in America, but have you ever considered coming over here?
2013-12-29 02:59:55	Los_Plagas	Some people say the US's way is triumph, but others . . . not so much. 
2013-12-29 03:00:00	Espyo	well, not to study
2013-12-29 03:01:25	Los_Plagas	Hmm . . . I'm not so sure about the reliability of a /job/ at the US. Lately, they've been trying to put up a lot of systems to help with unemployment, but there's still a lot of jobless people.
2013-12-29 03:01:35	Espyo	everybody's unemployed everywhere
2013-12-29 03:01:39	Espyo	though over here, it's as bad as 17%
2013-12-29 03:02:23	Los_Plagas	Yeah, the US is 7%
2013-12-29 03:02:28	Espyo	wow
2013-12-29 03:02:35	Los_Plagas	I know.
2013-12-29 03:02:44	Los_Plagas	I think it might be because the US is one of the richer countries.
2013-12-29 03:03:00	Los_Plagas	The richer countries probably have less unemployed people. 
2013-12-29 03:03:11	Los_Plagas	But the economy's suffering, and we still have the huge debt to China.
2013-12-29 03:03:12	Espyo	mhm
2013-12-29 03:03:41	Los_Plagas	Perhaps Japan. Unemployment rate: 4%.
2013-12-29 03:03:54	Espyo	that's insane
2013-12-29 03:04:56	Los_Plagas	Wait, wait wait: Qatar's the leader with 0.5 %. That's amazing.
2013-12-29 03:05:08	Espyo	...
2013-12-29 03:05:13	Espyo	almost seems impossible
2013-12-29 03:05:23	Los_Plagas	Though that might just be because it's tiny.
2013-12-29 03:05:42	Espyo	true
2013-12-29 03:09:55	Los_Plagas	Based on statistics alone, though, Sealand's probably the way to go.
2013-12-29 03:10:03	Los_Plagas	Until you look up the word Sealand.
2013-12-29 03:10:11	Los_Plagas	I'm pretty sure Sealand has 0%.
2013-12-29 03:12:42	Espyo	heh
2013-12-29 03:13:09	Los_Plagas	Sealand's either rich or small
2013-12-29 03:13:17	Los_Plagas	It's small if you don't feel up to guessing
2013-12-29 03:13:29	Espyo	heh, I imagined
2013-12-29 03:13:59	Los_Plagas	Population of . . . *gasp* 27.
2013-12-29 03:15:36	Espyo	._.
2013-12-29 03:18:18	Los_Plagas	Yep yep yep
2013-12-29 03:18:36	Los_Plagas	And the strange thing is that they have rulers, too . . . kings and queens. . . .
2013-12-29 03:20:19	Espyo	wow
2013-12-29 03:20:21	Espyo	that is pretty weird
2013-12-29 03:30:29	Los_Plagas	Dinner now. Be back in a bit.
2013-12-29 03:31:32	Espyo	I have to go now anyway
2013-12-29 03:31:34	Espyo	 3:30 here

2013-12-30 12:43:59	Espyo	hey
2013-12-30 12:44:04	Espyo	I was thinking about you
2013-12-30 12:44:10	PikFan	I'm on 3DS, so unsteady connection
2013-12-30 12:44:10	Espyo	listen, I need to ask you something about P3
2013-12-30 12:44:19	Espyo	https://www.facebook.com/ThatGuyFromPikmin2WhoEatsAnything/posts/530116287085469
2013-12-30 12:44:21	PikFan	hmm?
2013-12-30 12:44:28	Espyo	does that guy mean DWARF Bulborbs, or mature ones?

2013-12-30 12:47:01	Espyo	oh, could've said, I would've just copy-pasted then
2013-12-30 12:47:03	Espyo	but meh
2013-12-30 12:47:14	PikFan	well Nintendo decided to call Red Bulborbs just "Bulborbs" in this game
2013-12-30 12:47:22	PikFan	well Nintendo decided to call Red Bulborbs just "Bulborbs" in this game
2013-12-30 12:47:24	Espyo	hm
2013-12-30 12:47:32	Espyo	(also you posted that twice)
2013-12-30 12:47:42	PikFan	heh
2013-12-30 12:48:13	PikFan	that guy was referring to swarming, right?
2013-12-30 12:48:38	Espyo	~yep
2013-12-30 12:48:41	Espyo	*-~
2013-12-30 12:49:08	PikFan	then he was likely talking about the mature one
2013-12-30 12:49:49	PikFan	and iirc Dwarf Red Bulborbs are called Dwarf Bulborbs
2013-12-30 12:50:13	Espyo	right
2013-12-30 12:50:21	Espyo	are there any hairy, or oranges, or etc.?
2013-12-30 12:50:31	PikFan	anyway, I noticed something
2013-12-30 12:50:57	PikFan	yeah, there're Oranges, but no Hairys
2013-12-30 12:51:02	Espyo	ah
2013-12-30 12:51:45	PikFan	so you can pluck Pikmin sprouts as soon as they hit the ground
2013-12-30 12:52:04	Espyo	not sure how to feel about that
2013-12-30 12:52:10	Espyo	but yeah, I've been thinking
2013-12-30 12:52:20	Espyo	it's clear now that the P3 staff is different from the P2 one
2013-12-30 12:52:25	Espyo	so many little things work differently
2013-12-30 12:52:29	Espyo	and not necessarily for the best
2013-12-30 12:52:33	Espyo	some are better, some are worse
2013-12-30 12:52:49	Espyo	but overall, the only thing "Pikmin" about Pikmin 3 is the characters and the general concept
2013-12-30 12:53:01	Espyo	gameplay-wise, P3 seems like it's so much different from the rest...
2013-12-30 12:53:16	PikFan	yeah; you can't select Pikmin stages, or change the camera's zoom level
2013-12-30 12:54:41	PikFan	obviously the staff didn't pay attention to the gameplay mechs in P2
2013-12-30 12:54:42	Espyo	ugh
2013-12-30 12:54:59	Espyo	or they figured they'd change things to their own accord, regardless of how the gameplay feels
2013-12-30 12:55:29	Espyo	Miyamoto said that the Wii U's higher graphic capabilities allowed for the game to be fully zoomed out, and still understandable, something not really possible on P1/2
2013-12-30 12:55:41	Espyo	so what does the staff interpret that as?
2013-12-30 12:55:49	Espyo	"only have the most zoomed out zoom mode"
2013-12-30 12:55:56	Espyo	laziness, in my opinion
2013-12-30 12:56:03	Espyo	looks like they cut corners everywhere
2013-12-30 12:56:21	PikFan	hmm
2013-12-30 12:56:58	PikFan	maybe I should compare the credits of 2 and 3, and spot any differences

2013-12-30 12:59:35	PikFan	3DS is _so_ unreliable
2013-12-30 13:00:29	PikFan	anyway, I still thought P3 was great, despite its bad controls
2013-12-30 13:01:22	PikFan	and I've hardly used the GamePad to play
2013-12-30 13:01:52	PikFan	the whistle button is in such a weird spot
2013-12-30 13:02:23	PikFan	it's like... ZR or something
2013-12-30 13:03:28	PikFan	either it's overly complicated or I just don't understand the controls on the GamePad yet

2013-12-30 13:11:54	Espyo	heh
2013-12-30 13:12:09	Espyo	I even know exactly how many enemies spawn in dead ends and everything!
2013-12-30 13:12:42	PikFan	so did you rewrite it, and add statistical + technical information?
2013-12-30 13:12:57	PikFan	wow
2013-12-30 13:13:10	Espyo	yep
2013-12-30 13:13:14	Espyo	well, not so much a rewrite
2013-12-30 13:13:21	PikFan	you've become omniscient, haven't you?
2013-12-30 13:13:22	Espyo	I left the walkthrough bits mostly intact
2013-12-30 13:13:25	Espyo	only fixed some typos
2013-12-30 13:13:29	Espyo	in terms of Pikmin 2 cave data? yep
2013-12-30 13:13:40	Espyo	I'm not the first one, though, but I AM going to add it all to the wiki
2013-12-30 13:13:42	Espyo	and that's what matters
2013-12-30 13:14:10	PikFan	right
2013-12-30 13:14:11	Espyo	it takes like 10 minutes to fill in the info on a single sublevel, though...
2013-12-30 13:14:27	Espyo	or it did, yesterday, while I was still trying to figure out why the "enemy max" didn't match, and stuff like that
2013-12-30 13:14:29	PikFan	:s
2013-12-30 13:14:41	Espyo	other than the enemy max, most other things seem to match up nicely
2013-12-30 13:14:52	Espyo	so it's safe to assume the info in the game files matches reality
2013-12-30 13:14:54	PikFan	I see
2013-12-30 13:14:56	Espyo	got lunch, brb
2013-12-30 13:15:40	PikFan	one thing I don't get: why are there so many tiles for sublevel 9?
2013-12-30 13:15:57	PikFan	oh, ok
2013-12-30 13:16:41	Espyo	(rice is still cooking >_>)
2013-12-30 13:16:50	Espyo	it's what's defined in the game's files, really
2013-12-30 13:16:56	PikFan	I need to sleep anyway -- it's 5:16 am
2013-12-30 13:16:58	Espyo	in practice, only the main arena exists
2013-12-30 13:17:00	Espyo	wow
2013-12-30 13:17:15	PikFan	I see
2013-12-30 13:17:16	Espyo	go then, before you flop dead heh
2013-12-30 13:17:21	Espyo	hmm
2013-12-30 13:17:31	Espyo	but I should point out the dead ends and corridors aren't used
2013-12-30 13:17:41	PikFan	well, good night... or good afternoon

2013-12-30 16:41:44	@J	.
2013-12-30 16:41:58	Espyo	hey
2013-12-30 16:42:57	Espyo	so here's a tiny factoid I discovered
2013-12-30 16:42:59	Espyo	Maybe, just maybe, sublevel 5 of the Hole of Beasts was meant to have a different song, as the line in the music config file for the 5th sublevel is copy-pasted and unchanged from the 4th.
2013-12-30 16:43:58	@J	super-tiny
2013-12-30 16:44:23	Espyo	mhm
2013-12-30 16:44:29	@J	you mean it can leave it out and default to something else?
2013-12-30 16:45:11	Espyo	you're asking if it's possible to omit the a sublevel's song on the config file and the game will use a default one?
2013-12-30 16:46:36	@J	yeah
2013-12-30 16:46:43	Espyo	nope, it's not the case
2013-12-30 16:46:45	@J	otherwise how do you know it's copy/pasted?
2013-12-30 16:46:53	Espyo	hehe, hang on
2013-12-30 16:47:49	Espyo	http://pastebin.com/9nZgWkn6
2013-12-30 16:48:03	Espyo	the Japanese there means "sublevel2
2013-12-30 16:48:05	Espyo	*"
2013-12-30 16:49:37	@J	I don't really see how that implies it was meant to have different music
2013-12-30 16:49:47	Espyo	it doesn't
2013-12-30 16:49:54	Espyo	hence the "Maybe, just maybe"
2013-12-30 16:50:03	@J	but I don't see how it implies it at all
2013-12-30 16:50:13	Espyo	Totaka (these files belong to him) was filing in the file, copy-pasting one line at a time
2013-12-30 16:50:33	Espyo	and when he got to the last one, MAYBE he was gonna change it, but something could've happened and he forgot, leaving the unaltered copy-pasted line forever
2013-12-30 16:50:40	Espyo	it's obvious it's copy-pasted because of the comment
2013-12-30 16:50:50	@J	yes
2013-12-30 16:50:58	Espyo	but if he were to finalize the decision that sublevel 5 would have that song, he would organize his file
2013-12-30 16:51:04	Espyo	I mean, organize the comment
2013-12-30 16:51:06	@J	but what would they do where the music was actually meant to be the same?
2013-12-30 16:51:13	@J	they would also just copy/paste, right?
2013-12-30 16:51:19	Espyo	yes, but fix the comment
2013-12-30 16:51:38	Espyo	all other lines that are the same have the comment fixed for the appropriate sublevel
2013-12-30 16:52:04	Espyo	http://pastebin.com/cGskNFJT
2013-12-30 16:53:11	@J	oh, I see
2013-12-30 16:53:12	@J	okay
2013-12-30 16:53:30	Espyo	chances it's a mistake are low, but existen
2013-12-30 16:53:31	Espyo	*t
2013-12-30 16:53:39	Espyo	also, another thing I found out, you can even see on the latest pastebin
2013-12-30 16:53:59	Espyo	one of the songs makes reference to glass-type caves...
2013-12-30 16:55:09	Espyo	the music configuration files are really hard to understand
2013-12-30 16:55:20	Espyo	but that "glass cave" song shares something with the rest sublevel song
2013-12-30 16:55:26	Espyo	in that there's a file just for the two of them
2013-12-30 16:55:36	Espyo	and supposedly, they're both meant to be streams, not MIDI
2013-12-30 17:25:04	@J	(back later, maybe)
2013-12-30 17:29:20	Espyo	mhm

2013-12-30 20:19:44	Testyo	Hi everyone!
2013-12-30 20:19:45	Testyo	Oh, Prez, you have a memo from Espyo, written on 28/12/2013 19:22 (GMT), saying: would you happen to know who owns the Pikipedia Facebook page? https://www.facebook.com/pages/Pikipedia/171251012917698.
2013-12-30 20:27:16	Espyo	also Prez, delete this when you can http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Ido1&rcid=31144
2013-12-30 20:34:47	Prez	I have absolutely no idea. I don't even have a FB account
2013-12-30 20:35:52	Espyo	oh well
2013-12-30 20:36:13	Espyo	Los_Plagas seems to have sent Lord Raven a message on twitter asking if it's him
2013-12-30 20:36:21	Espyo	because the edit that linked to the facebook page on the main page was made by him
2013-12-30 20:37:27	Prez	huh. guess that would make sense. though I'm surprised he's bothering with an FB page when he doesn't even visit the wiki
2013-12-30 20:37:34	Espyo	yeah
2013-12-30 20:37:48	Espyo	anyway, I use facebook kinda often
2013-12-30 20:37:50	Prez	AND considering he would probably get more out of linking to the old site
2013-12-30 20:37:52	Espyo	visit my feed once a day
2013-12-30 20:37:58	Espyo	so I was thinking of taking over the page
2013-12-30 20:38:01	Espyo	give it new life
2013-12-30 20:38:11	Espyo	hopefully this will be a way to give Pikipedia as a whole more activity
2013-12-30 20:38:26	Prez	worth a try i guess
2013-12-30 20:38:52	Espyo	anyway, PikFan got Pikmin 3
2013-12-30 20:38:58	Espyo	in a few days he's gonna start adding some info
2013-12-30 20:41:50	Prez	yeah I'm at home right now, can't add anything. I think i managed two enemies though before i left hahah
2013-12-30 20:41:52	Prez	go me
2013-12-30 20:42:31	Espyo	heh, it's ok
2013-12-30 20:42:33	Espyo	slow and steady, etc.
2013-12-30 20:42:46	Prez	nah I've just been lazy as hell
2013-12-30 20:43:14	Prez	in pretty much every aspect of my life this last month
2013-12-30 20:43:59	Espyo	meh, we all have lazy months
2013-12-30 20:44:28	Prez	well I have to wait until next winter now before i can switch college topics. I'll probably just end up wasting away that time
2013-12-30 20:44:45	Prez	so hoping to get SOMETHING done during that time
2013-12-30 20:45:40	Espyo	right
2013-12-30 20:45:47	Espyo	one whole year left
2013-12-30 20:46:08	Prez	well, until like september
2013-12-30 20:46:23	Prez	but yeah close enough to a full year 
2013-12-30 20:46:33	Espyo	oh, right
2013-12-30 20:49:06	Prez	love what you're doing with the cave stuff by the way
2013-12-30 20:50:50	Espyo	thanks
2013-12-30 20:50:56	Espyo	turned out to be a lot better than what I had in mind
2013-12-30 20:51:02	Espyo	it's super detailed without being filler
2013-12-30 20:51:11	Espyo	and the cave units are actually easy to understand
2013-12-30 20:51:22	Espyo	just wish there weren't so many incognitos, though
2013-12-30 20:51:30	Espyo	like the max enemies attribute for a floor
2013-12-30 20:51:33	Espyo	makes no sense whatsoever
2013-12-30 20:51:36	Espyo	max caps too
2013-12-30 20:51:39	Espyo	anyway, dinner
2013-12-30 20:51:43	Espyo	brb
2013-12-30 21:05:56	Espyo	and back
2013-12-30 21:06:17	Prez	man that DLC stuff has been out for a while i think
2013-12-30 21:06:26	Prez	i really need to buy a wireless router
2013-12-30 21:07:00	Espyo	you really do
2013-12-30 21:07:03	Espyo	it makes everything easier
2013-12-30 21:07:10	Prez	it's 2014 soon and Nintendo still doesn't have consoles with Ethernet inlets, wonderful
2013-12-30 21:07:21	Espyo	hehe
2013-12-30 21:08:25	Prez	wow so funny story
2013-12-30 21:09:38	Prez	a friend of mine started streaming on Twitch, and I watch the SpeedRunsLive guys all day and night, and figured I might give it a try too, worst case i played some games and have an HD card for the wiki
2013-12-30 21:10:32	Espyo	I don't get that last bit
2013-12-30 21:10:37	Espyo	also, I forgot to do this before:
2013-12-30 21:10:37	Prez	So if I had to speedrun something it probably would be sonic 06, so I look up some runs and the first one is of AGDQ and guess who's sitting right next to the runner
2013-12-30 21:10:51	Espyo	Testyo: memo PikFan http://pikmin.wikia.com/wiki/Pikmin_Wiki >Do not be afraid chosen one for you can go hop in and edit!
2013-12-30 21:10:52	Testyo	Done. I saved a memo for PikFan saying: http://pikmin.wikia.com/wiki/Pikmin_Wiki >Do not be afraid chosen one for you can go hop in and edit!.
2013-12-30 21:11:01	Espyo	Miles?
2013-12-30 21:11:13	Prez	yep
2013-12-30 21:11:16	Espyo	hehehe
2013-12-30 21:11:21	Espyo	nobody is a stranger to Sonic 06
2013-12-30 21:12:09	Prez	I kind of liked it a little bit actually, especially the parts with Silver
2013-12-30 21:12:27	Espyo	I never played it, but from what I've seen...
2013-12-30 21:12:41	Espyo	there's just no possible comment
2013-12-30 21:12:41	Prez	It can be fun if you don't die all the time, but if you play it for the first... well, you'll die. a lot
2013-12-30 21:13:16	Prez	I think there should still be a lot of bugs to be found that can be abused
2013-12-30 21:13:17	Espyo	 06 sounds like one of those games I'd get JUST to have fun breaking it
2013-12-30 21:13:25	Espyo	mhm
2013-12-30 21:18:07	Miles	>_>
2013-12-30 21:18:51	Miles	06 will be great this year
2013-12-30 21:18:55	Miles	Considering it's now 15 minutes long
2013-12-30 21:19:17	Espyo	ah yes, DarkSpinesSonic found a new glitch
2013-12-30 21:19:26	Espyo	you talk to someone who starts a mission and die at the same time
2013-12-30 21:19:47	Espyo	then you start the mission outside of talking to the person
2013-12-30 21:19:49	Espyo	complete it
2013-12-30 21:19:51	Espyo	and boom, game complete
2013-12-30 21:20:18	Miles	Too bad it's going to be Sonic
2013-12-30 21:20:22	Miles	Silver is much better
2013-12-30 21:20:31	Espyo	Silver can pull that glitch off faster, can't he?
2013-12-30 21:20:44	Miles	Silver's ending is falling into a pit for 30 seconds
2013-12-30 21:20:46	Miles	Die
2013-12-30 21:20:48	Miles	Credits
2013-12-30 21:20:56	Miles	I think Silver is a bit faster but not by much
2013-12-30 21:20:58	Espyo	wow, I don't remember seeing that
2013-12-30 21:21:09	Espyo	did DSS discover that trick too?
2013-12-30 21:21:42	Miles	It's the same glitch
2013-12-30 21:21:58	Miles	Just the end result involves falling into nothingness and dying
2013-12-30 21:22:11	Espyo	oh
2013-12-30 21:22:38	Prez	for someone who never played it you know a lot about it espyo
2013-12-30 21:22:56	Espyo	hehe, I've seen two playthroughs of it
2013-12-30 21:23:09	Espyo	and I'm subscribed to DSS, Paraxade, and a few others
2013-12-30 21:23:17	Espyo	they occasionally post runs and glitches
2013-12-30 21:23:18	Prez	ah
2013-12-30 21:23:48	Miles	I played it about 2 years ago
2013-12-30 21:23:53	Miles	It's certainly a thing
2013-12-30 21:24:44	Espyo	 7:10 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWgRzJzVOXA
2013-12-30 21:24:51	Espyo	all I saw was the normal Silver method
2013-12-30 21:24:56	Espyo	never seen him falling for 30 seconds
2013-12-30 21:25:05	Espyo	I'll search on youtube
2013-12-30 21:25:53	Prez	Think there's a difference between 360 and ps3?
2013-12-30 21:26:52	Espyo	I think that glitch works in both
2013-12-30 21:26:55	Espyo	it's in the description, maybe
2013-12-30 21:28:50	Miles	http://www.twitch.tv/darkspinessonic/c/3073225
2013-12-30 21:29:59	Espyo	...the day twitch works on Firefox...
2013-12-30 21:30:40	Espyo	even on Chrome it's taking a while
2013-12-30 21:32:39	Prez	yeah, there's addons for that though, if you don't mind even more crap installed for making twitch bearable
2013-12-30 21:32:53	Espyo	oh
2013-12-30 21:32:54	Espyo	didn't know
2013-12-30 21:32:59	Espyo	still, I'd rather open Chrome real quick
2013-12-30 21:44:50	Espyo	pfffft
2013-12-30 21:44:54	Espyo	Silver's version is the best

2013-12-30 22:13:17	@J	*?
2013-12-30 22:13:38	@J	like, if they only allow 1 unit and some have gates

2013-12-30 23:16:39	@PikFan	...what
2013-12-30 23:16:46	Espyo	do not be afraid...
2013-12-30 23:16:48	Espyo	chosen one...
2013-12-30 23:16:53	Espyo	these people are officially retarded
2013-12-30 23:17:19	Espyo	Prez pointed it out
2013-12-30 23:17:23	Espyo	and it took me a while to believe it
2013-12-30 23:17:58	@PikFan	...unbelievable
2013-12-30 23:18:11	@PikFan	greedy monsters, that's what they are
2013-12-30 23:18:31	@PikFan	their wiki is /full/ of bias
2013-12-30 23:18:44	Espyo	that intro doesn't even make any /sense/
2013-12-30 23:19:25	@PikFan	it'd make more sense if they got rid of the "chosen one" part
2013-12-30 23:20:01	Espyo	yeah!...
2013-12-30 23:20:17	@PikFan	well, a minuscule bit more sense
2013-12-30 23:20:48	@PikFan	actually it'd make more sense if they ditched it altogether
2013-12-30 23:23:45	@PikFan	oh, about P3
2013-12-30 23:23:55	@PikFan	remembered how you said there isn't a map?
2013-12-30 23:24:17	@PikFan	that it's just the area viewed from above?
2013-12-30 23:24:37	Espyo	yeah?
2013-12-30 23:24:55	@PikFan	well, there is a map — it's on the GamePad
2013-12-30 23:25:01	Espyo	radar-styled?
2013-12-30 23:25:08	@PikFan	yeah, kinda
2013-12-30 23:25:14	@PikFan	it's got icons and stuff
2013-12-30 23:25:19	Espyo	ah
2013-12-30 23:25:44	@PikFan	and the icons are realistic
2013-12-30 23:26:02	@PikFan	i.e. they look like what they're representing
2013-12-30 23:26:51	Espyo	neat
2013-12-30 23:29:29	@PikFan	so when you get your hands on P3 you'll be able to get the radar data on the wiki
2013-12-30 23:31:37	Espyo	yeah
2013-12-30 23:31:46	@PikFan	oh, another thing
2013-12-30 23:31:49	Espyo	well, I'll have to crop them
2013-12-30 23:31:59	@PikFan	I've started taking statistical info from P3
2013-12-30 23:32:01	Espyo	I have the P2 icons because Dolphin actually dumps the pure textures
2013-12-30 23:32:04	Espyo	ah, good
2013-12-30 23:33:03	@PikFan	and since I've already played through it /incompletely/ once, I should start to make articles
2013-12-30 23:33:15	Espyo	yeah
2013-12-30 23:33:16	Espyo	good luck
2013-12-30 23:33:23	@PikFan	thanks
2013-12-30 23:33:51	@PikFan	what about fruits that were treasure in P2?
2013-12-30 23:34:01	Espyo	we'll just have both templates
2013-12-30 23:34:02	@PikFan	what about fruits that were treasure in P2??
2013-12-30 23:34:06	@PikFan	...oops
2013-12-30 23:34:10	Espyo	treasure at the start of the article, fruit later
2013-12-30 23:34:33	@PikFan	(have no idea how I wrote that twice)
2013-12-30 23:35:00	Espyo	heh
2013-12-30 23:35:01	@PikFan	(maybe the curse from the 3DS followed me here :s )
2013-12-30 23:35:41	@PikFan	so I should write a P3 section on already existing articles?
2013-12-30 23:35:46	Espyo	yep
2013-12-30 23:35:49	@PikFan	got it
2013-12-30 23:35:52	Espyo	or a "as a fruit" section
2013-12-30 23:36:03	Espyo	try to make it as complete as possible, of course
2013-12-30 23:36:11	Espyo	exact location, how to get there, what to keep in mind before going, etc.
2013-12-30 23:36:16	@PikFan	right
2013-12-30 23:36:19	Espyo	also describe it and its real world counterpart
2013-12-30 23:36:25	Espyo	if you don't know what it is, add a ToDo

2013-12-30 23:36:39	@PikFan	yeah, I've been trying to figure out what kind of fruit each fruit is
2013-12-30 23:36:42	Espyo	it's better to have 80 ToDos than having articles with missing info going unnoticed for years
2013-12-30 23:36:50	Espyo	I'm not a fruit expert, so...

2013-12-30 23:37:12	@PikFan	my P3 guide says what kind of fruit the fruits are
2013-12-30 23:37:24	Espyo	ah
2013-12-30 23:37:25	@PikFan	so I'll be referring to the guide a lot, I'd imagine
2013-12-30 23:37:48	@PikFan	well, not referring, but looking at the guide
2013-12-30 23:38:16	@PikFan	also Brittany writes notes for the fruit
2013-12-30 23:38:29	Espyo	ah yes
2013-12-30 23:38:32	Espyo	remember to add those...
2013-12-30 23:38:34	Espyo	somewhere...?
2013-12-30 23:38:37	Espyo	ask J about how notes work
2013-12-30 23:38:40	@PikFan	so we'll have to add a "Brittany's notes" to that template
2013-12-30 23:38:57	@PikFan	I think I know how notes work, but I'll ask if I'm unsure
2013-12-30 23:40:50	Espyo	right
2013-12-30 23:40:55	@PikFan	so what should it be? should it be like "fruit" or "brittany" or something?
2013-12-30 23:40:57	Espyo	what about the other 2 captains? don't they save notes?
2013-12-30 23:41:01	Espyo	hmm
2013-12-30 23:41:02	@PikFan	no
2013-12-30 23:41:07	Espyo	probably britanny
2013-12-30 23:41:12	Espyo	we have "louie" and such, right?
2013-12-30 23:41:17	@PikFan	yeah
2013-12-30 23:41:31	@PikFan	*brittany
2013-12-30 23:41:51	Espyo	oops
2013-12-30 23:41:59	@PikFan	hehe
2013-12-30 23:42:35	@PikFan	hmm
2013-12-30 23:42:50	@PikFan	are there any other templates I'll have to change in addition to this one? http://www.pikminwiki.com/Template:Notes
2013-12-30 23:44:26	Espyo	don't think so
2013-12-30 23:44:32	Espyo	remember to add P3 to the icons
2013-12-30 23:44:37	Espyo	maybe write a text file with all these steps
2013-12-30 23:44:42	Espyo	so you don't skip any of them on accident
2013-12-30 23:44:56	@PikFan	...oh, it's protected
2013-12-30 23:44:59	Espyo	oh
2013-12-30 23:45:03	Espyo	all the more reasons to ask J then
2013-12-30 23:45:27	@PikFan	J, can you add a "brittany" notes to the notes template?
2013-12-30 23:45:49	@PikFan	wait, is J on right now, or is he asleep
2013-12-30 23:46:38	@J	?
2013-12-30 23:46:47	@PikFan	then you're awake
2013-12-30 23:47:15	@J	you need to change template:metadata too
2013-12-30 23:47:47	@PikFan	okay, so can you add a new... notes thingy to the notes
2013-12-30 23:47:52	@PikFan	oh ok
2013-12-30 23:48:23	Espyo	its 11 PM here
2013-12-30 23:48:41	@PikFan	*it's
2013-12-30 23:49:11	Espyo	the apostrophe didn't go through
2013-12-30 23:49:11	@PikFan	I didn't know that 11 was possessive...?
2013-12-30 23:49:20	@PikFan	ah, ok
2013-12-30 23:50:01	@J	what are the notes called?
2013-12-30 23:50:08	@J	I mean, is there an official name?
2013-12-30 23:50:12	@J	title when you view them?
2013-12-30 23:50:40	@PikFan	Espyo and I agreed on "brittany"
2013-12-30 23:51:05	Espyo	isn't the cooking notes "louie"?
2013-12-30 23:51:14	@PikFan	yeah
2013-12-30 23:51:22	Espyo	so... "brittany"
2013-12-30 23:51:37	@PikFan	and then the other thing should be "Brittany's Notes", or something
2013-12-30 23:52:19	@PikFan	well, neither of you know how to view the notes
2013-12-30 23:52:20	@J	'or something'?
2013-12-30 23:52:30	@J	that's the part I was asking about, the heading displayed on the page
2013-12-30 23:52:36	@PikFan	oh
2013-12-30 23:52:48	Espyo	if there is none, I say "Brittany's Notes" works fine
2013-12-30 23:53:48	@PikFan	if I could edit it then it'd be much easier
2013-12-30 23:54:20	@PikFan	kind of hard to explain because I don't know the terms for these kinds of things
2013-12-30 23:54:47	@J	I'm not sure what you're saying
2013-12-30 23:54:55	@J	all I'm asking is what they're called in-game
2013-12-30 23:55:03	Espyo	the title of the notes section on the article, right?
2013-12-30 23:55:06	@J	if they don't have a name, we'll use 'Brittany's notes'
2013-12-30 23:55:14	@PikFan	let me check
2013-12-31 00:05:03	@PikFan	well
2013-12-31 00:05:25	@PikFan	on the GamePad, there's an icon with a fruit on if
2013-12-31 00:05:57	@PikFan	if you press that, it takes you to a screen called "Fruit File", with icons of all the fruit you've collected up to this point
2013-12-31 00:06:57	@PikFan	if you click on a fruit, it shows the name of the fruit, how many of those fruits you've collected, how much juice it's worth, how many Pikmin are needed to carry, and Brittany's notes
2013-12-31 00:07:12	Espyo	hmm
2013-12-31 00:09:08	@PikFan	so should we call it "Brittany's Fruit File", or "Brittany's notes"?
2013-12-31 00:10:37	@J	fruit file seems to be more than just the notes, so I'll use the latter
2013-12-31 00:10:44	@J	we can easily change it later, anyway
2013-12-31 00:11:00	@PikFan	okay
2013-12-31 00:11:14	@J	should work now
2013-12-31 00:19:43	@J	got to go, bye
2013-12-31 00:20:00	@PikFan	bye
2013-12-31 00:20:04	@PikFan	and thank you
2013-12-31 00:20:19	Espyo	bye
2013-12-31 00:27:45	@PikFan	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Sunseed_Berry
2013-12-31 00:27:59	@PikFan	ugh, it looks so... messy
2013-12-31 00:28:44	Espyo	more like /broken/
2013-12-31 00:28:55	Espyo	wait, never mind
2013-12-31 00:29:00	Espyo	put the P2 infobox on the start of the article
2013-12-31 00:29:56	@PikFan	yeah
2013-12-31 00:30:12	@PikFan	there's that ugly white space at the top
2013-12-31 00:30:26	@PikFan	going to fix that
2013-12-31 00:30:54	@PikFan	...uh-oh
2013-12-31 00:32:06	@PikFan	on the section headers for Pikmin 2 and Pikmin 3, the game icons cover the Edit button
2013-12-31 00:32:51	@PikFan	and tbh, I don't think they need to be there, since there are already game icons at the top
2013-12-31 00:34:04	Espyo	hm
2013-12-31 00:34:09	Espyo	yeah...
2013-12-31 00:34:16	Espyo	J needs to rewrite the game icon code
2013-12-31 00:34:58	@PikFan	for now I'll put both infoboxes above the headers
2013-12-31 00:35:15	@PikFan	...or not
2013-12-31 00:35:20	@PikFan	hmmmmmmm
2013-12-31 00:35:26	Espyo	ignore the icons for now
2013-12-31 00:58:43	@PikFan	just finished adding the info
2013-12-31 01:03:22	Espyo	yeah, I see
2013-12-31 01:03:28	Espyo	one down, hundreds more to go
2013-12-31 01:03:41	@PikFan	no
2013-12-31 01:03:51	@PikFan	there's not even a hundred types of fruit
2013-12-31 01:04:08	@PikFan	I'm not going to state how many types there are though
2013-12-31 01:04:16	@PikFan	because spoilers
2013-12-31 01:04:54	Espyo	I meant everything
2013-12-31 01:04:56	Espyo	enemies, areas, etc.
2013-12-31 01:05:03	Espyo	probably 20
2013-12-31 01:05:13	Espyo	anyway, is it really called the Sunseed Berry in P3 as well?
2013-12-31 01:05:14	@PikFan	oh
2013-12-31 01:05:20	@PikFan	yep
2013-12-31 01:05:44	@PikFan	let's see... the Cupid's Grenade and the Disguised Delicacy return as well
2013-12-31 01:06:12	Espyo	ah
2013-12-31 01:06:47	@PikFan	as does the Insect Condo and Citrus Lump
2013-12-31 01:14:10	Espyo	Miles: does SDA have a board where it's possible to discuss submitted runs?
2013-12-31 01:14:36	Espyo	'cause I'm watching the latest Lion King (SNES) run, and it looks to me like the runner doesn't use a shortcut
2013-12-31 01:14:53	Espyo	maybe I'm remembering wrong and that path isn't a shortcut, or maybe it's just absent altogether in the SNES version
2013-12-31 01:14:58	Miles	Search Older Consoles for a Lion King thread
2013-12-31 01:15:00	Espyo	but I'd like to point it out to the runner somehow
2013-12-31 01:15:10	Espyo	right, thanks
2013-12-31 01:21:00	Espyo	well, now I needed to create an account just to point that out
2013-12-31 01:21:01	Espyo	...nuts
2013-12-31 01:21:23	Espyo	hm, I'll try checking if the shortcut exists on SNES tomorrow before I jump to any conclusions
2013-12-31 01:30:46	@PikFan	Espyo, remember how that one guy came to #Testyo and you told me to ignore him?
2013-12-31 01:30:58	Espyo	yeah, I banned him
2013-12-31 01:30:59	Espyo	I... think
2013-12-31 01:31:10	@PikFan	he's wreaking havoc in #mwchat
2013-12-31 01:31:14	Espyo	eesh
2013-12-31 01:31:21	Espyo	I thought he was banned from #mwchat
2013-12-31 01:31:23	Espyo	TVTrash, was it?
2013-12-31 01:31:28	@PikFan	mhm
2013-12-31 01:31:34	@PikFan	yeah, his ban expired
2013-12-31 01:31:36	@PikFan	17:19	TVTrash	T
2013-12-31 01:31:38	Espyo	...
2013-12-31 01:31:47	@PikFan	17:19	TVTrash	F
2013-12-31 01:31:57	@PikFan	17:19	TVTrash	P
2013-12-31 01:32:10	Espyo	I know it stirs up rage, and that's what's fun to him
2013-12-31 01:32:11	@PikFan	17:20	TVTrash	you suck'
2013-12-31 01:32:17	Espyo	but come on, how sad do you have to be to do that all day
2013-12-31 01:32:47	@PikFan	there's something very wrong with him, because he said this
2013-12-31 01:32:55	@PikFan	23:18   TVTrash   I wish kids shold be allowed to use E-cigs
2013-12-31 01:33:10	Espyo	yeah, he's just trying to evoke responses
2013-12-31 01:33:17	Espyo	that's why I told you to ignore him last time
2013-12-31 01:34:17	@PikFan	I see
2013-12-31 01:34:25	Espyo	he quickly lost interest
2013-12-31 01:34:30	Espyo	on #mwchat on the other hand, he keeps going
2013-12-31 01:34:32	Espyo	he's having fun
2013-12-31 01:34:36	Espyo	also why isn't nobody banning him?
2013-12-31 01:34:40	@PikFan	also I checked #Testyo's AKICK list; he isn't in there
2013-12-31 01:34:45	@PikFan	well an op warned him
2013-12-31 01:34:48	Espyo	I mean, the #mwchat mods are ban-happy
2013-12-31 01:34:55	Espyo	...
2013-12-31 01:35:01	Espyo	a warning comes in the form of a kick
2013-12-31 01:35:07	Espyo	and if he does the same, there's no need to hesitate
2013-12-31 01:35:12	Espyo	they ban people for the pettiest of things
2013-12-31 01:35:18	@PikFan	no, it was a verbal warning
2013-12-31 01:35:25	@PikFan	here, read for yourself
2013-12-31 01:35:30	@PikFan	http://mibpaste.com/POKKI3 
2013-12-31 01:35:44	Espyo	but if it's a proven spammer, who's been banned before, and is showing himself to spam again, they don't ban him?
2013-12-31 01:35:51	Espyo	...did a spider just land near my ear
2013-12-31 01:36:12	@PikFan	...?
2013-12-31 01:36:18	Espyo	I felt and heard something
2013-12-31 01:36:22	Espyo	shook it off, landed on my chair
2013-12-31 01:36:31	@PikFan	what was it
2013-12-31 01:36:36	Espyo	didn't understand its shape, but it was squishable
2013-12-31 01:36:46	<--	RingtailedFox (Ringtailed@p57-35-8-400.home.cgocable.net) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2013-12-31 01:36:47	Espyo	anyway, I meant that a warning SHOULD come in the form of a kick
2013-12-31 01:36:49	Espyo	that's norm in IRC
2013-12-31 01:36:54	Espyo	if someone needs a warning, kick them
2013-12-31 01:36:58	Espyo	that should make them listen
2013-12-31 01:36:59	@PikFan	oh
2013-12-31 01:37:01	@PikFan	I see
2013-12-31 01:37:04	Espyo	if they keep going, ban them
2013-12-31 01:37:20	Espyo	this is an IRC ban, not a death penalty, no need to think so much about banning
2013-12-31 01:37:31	Espyo	SPECIALLY when they know he's just there to cause chaos
2013-12-31 01:37:35	@PikFan	...now he
2013-12-31 01:37:43	@PikFan	now he's abusing colors
2013-12-31 01:38:06	Espyo	all the more reasons for me to consider the #mwchat mods idiots
2013-12-31 01:38:07	Espyo	good grief
2013-12-31 01:38:09	@PikFan	he keeps using white despite being told not to
2013-12-31 01:39:05	@PikFan	17:38	Anton{Politoed}	it would be great if you just settled on a color
2013-12-31 01:39:15	@PikFan	(he switched to another color)
2013-12-31 01:41:37	Espyo	just BAN HIM already!
2013-12-31 01:41:38	Espyo	gaah
2013-12-31 01:41:46	Espyo	they're making me rage more than TVTrash ever could alone!
2013-12-31 01:42:03	@PikFan	you would make a great op
